Mental Health

Mental health is a continuum, ranging from states of well-being to stressful life experiences to severe mental disorders. We hope that readers of Mental Health and Mental Disorders: An Encyclopedia of Conditions, Treatments, and Well-Being will find it a useful reference source for specific purposes like academic assignments, term papers, job reports, or, more generally, for better understanding themselves and others. This three-volume encyclopedia is subtitled An Encyclopedia of Conditions, Treatments, and Well-Being. The following paragraphs will focus on these three concepts: conditions or mental disorders, treatments, and well-being. Before that let’s
first look at mental health.

Mental Health
So what is mental health? Mental health can be thought of as successful mental functioning that results in productive activities, fulfilling relationships, and the ability to cope with change and adversity. Another way of saying this is that mental health is indispensable to effective personal functioning, interpersonal and family relationships, and community life.
   Change exerts a constant influence on mental health and can be a major source of anxiety for many in their personal and professional lives. Change, by itself, whether for good or not, can be a source of stress and can negatively influence mental health. For example, technological changes continue at an accelerating pace, and while they can be useful to many individuals, they pose a stressful challenge to others.
   Advances in health care can positively or negatively affect mental health. For example, older adults today have increased their life and health expectancies compared with Americans 10 years ago. That means that those over the age of 65 have fewer physical health concerns. But a decline in mental faculties among an increasing number of aging adults can create significant mental health concerns. For instance, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease were not major health and mental health concerns in the past because relatively few lived past the age of 60. In 1900 there were 120,000 Americans over age 85, while today there are more than 4 million older adults of that age, making them the fastest-growing age group. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that by 2030 there will be 72 million adults over the age of 65, which represents 20% of the American population. Among those 85 and older it is estimated that 50% will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (Vincent and Velkof, 2010). The point of these examples is that mental health and mental disorders are influenced by various factors.



Mental Disorders
Mental disorders are primarily disorders of the brain. These conditions usually have multiple causes and result from complex interactions between individuals’ genes and their environment. Lifestyle factors and health behaviors, like smoking and exercise, and life experiences, such as severe and prolonged stress or a history of abuse, are such factors. Typically, such factors interact with an individual’s genetic or biological predisposition to a mental disorder. For example, a traumatic brain injury or a mother’s exposure to viruses or toxic chemicals while pregnant may play a part. Other factors that can increase the risk for mental illness are the use of illegal drugs or having a serious medical condition like cancer. Research on the causality of mental illness has convincingly replaced the now-disproved belief that mental illness is a moral failure.
   Mental illnesses occur at similar rates around the world, in every culture and in all socioeconomic groups. Statistics reveal that one in five individuals suffer from a mental disorder. This represents at least 20% of Americans. However, only one-fourth of those individuals with disorders are receiving treatment (SAMHSA, 2014). And, currently, only about 4% of America’s health-care budget is spent on mental health treatment and prevention.
   The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (called DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, provides a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is the most commonly used clarification system in North America. It classifies mental disorders into categories. There are more than 20 categories of which the following are the most common.

• Anxiety disorders are disturbances in brain mechanisms designed to protect you from harm.
• Mood disorders are disturbances in usual mood states.
• Psychotic disorders are disturbances of thinking perception and behavior.
• Personality disorders are maladaptive personal characteristics.
• Eating disorders are disturbances of weight and feeding behavior.
• Substance-related and addiction disorders are disturbances of cravings.
• Neurodevelopmental disorders are early disturbances in usual brain development.
• Trauma and stressor-related disorders are disturbances related to significant stressful events.

   For example, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the trauma and stressor-related disorders. It is a common occurrence in those who witnessed or survived traumatic situations. Many veterans of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD and experience symptoms of flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of constant vigilance, and depression. But not all who were deployed to Iraq experience PTSD. Rather, it is most likely to occur in those with a biological predisposition.
   Depression is a mental disorder experienced by more than 120 million American adults each year. Depression is a leading cause of drug and alcohol use. Sleep difficulties result in nearly 50 million prescriptions being written for sleep medications per year. Many individuals manage their anxieties by overeating or smoking. Over

Introduction: Mental Health  

unhealthy ways of coping take their toll on physical as well as mental health, particularly in those who are predisposed to such conditions.


Significant advances have been made in the treatment of mental disorders. This increased understanding of the causes of mental health disorders (at least some of them) and increasingly effective treatments allow clinicians to better tailor treatment to those disorders. As a result, many mental health disorders can now be treated almost as effectively as medical conditions.
   Generally, treatment for mental health disorders is characterized as either somatic (biological) or psychological. Somatic treatments include drugs, electroconvulsive therapy, and other therapies that stimulate the brain. Psychological treatments include psychotherapy (individual, group, or family and marital), behavior therapy techniques (e.g., relaxation training or exposure therapy), and hypnotherapy. Research suggests that for major mental health disorders like major depressive disorder, a treatment approach involving both drugs and psychotherapy is more effective than either treatment method used alone.
   Clinicians who treat mental disorders include psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, mental health counselors, social workers, and psychiatric nurse practitioners. However, in most states, psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners are the only mental health clinicians licensed to prescribe drugs. Other clinicians practice psychotherapy primarily. Many primary care doctors and other medical specialists also prescribe drugs to treat mental health disorders.

In the past, mental health treatments focused largely on reducing symptoms or returning the individuals to their previous level of functioning. Today, however, treatment may also focus on increasing individuals’ functioning, resilience, and prevention. This focus is known as well-being. Well-being is defined as how individuals think about and experience their lives. It is an indicator of how well individuals perceive their lives to be going. It reflects several health, job, family, and social outcomes. Accordingly, higher levels of well-being are associated with decreased risk of disease, illness, and injury. It is associated with faster recovery for illness, better immunity, increased longevity, and better mental health. Those with high levels of well-being are more productive at work, tend to get along better with others, and are more likely to contribute to their communities.
   While there is not yet consensus among researchers or clinicians on the definition of well-being, most agree that well-being involves the presence of positive emotions and the absence of negative emotions. Most would agree that it includes satisfaction with life, a sense of personal fulfillment, and positive functioning. In short, it is about judging life positively and feeling good. Furthermore, most agree that well-being is broader and more inclusive than mental health. In fact, several kinds of well-being can be described and are currently being researched. These are physical well-being, economic well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being, and psychological



Depression, anxieties, addictive behaviors, and severe physical pain make it difficult to attain and maintain well-being. The reason is that these conditions interfere with the ability to see beyond one’s immediate negative experience.




Abandonment is a psychological concept that defines a set of emotional reactions and behavioral responses to perceptions of rejection or loss in personal relationships.

Abandonment, sometimes referred to as “abandonment issues,” is a psychological concept related to the fear of rejection, loss, and helplessness in personal relationships. Abandonment issues develop in childhood, cause stress in relationship, and are treatable. Abandonment issues are associated with intense feelings of fear, sadness, loneliness, anger, and worry in response to perceived rejection and disapproval. Breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, not being accepted by peers, someone not returning a phone call, or not being included in activities are examples of events that can cause feelings of abandonment. Abandonment dynamics are not identified as a specific psychological diagnosis but are included in the list of symptoms of various disorders such as borderline personality disorder and attachment disorders.
   Abandonment dynamics involve how events are perceived and the intensity of feelings resulting from those perceptions. Perceptions are the thoughts and beliefs about the event. Feelings are the emotional reaction connected to the thoughts and beliefs. For example, it would be appropriate for an individual who was not asked to go to the movies with a group of friends to feel disappointed. If the person believes he or she was not included because friends thought the person was not available, even though available, the


person perceives he or she was not included due to a misunderstanding about schedules. The person may feel disappointed or annoyed but is able to quickly get over it. A person with abandonment issues would perceive this as a personal rejection. The person would excessively worry over what he or she may have done to cause the rejection. The person may become enraged at being treated that way and spend days thinking about it and wondering why he or she was treated so unfairly. People with abandonment issues take things very personal and perceive events as extremely hurtful and are often overwhelmed by emotion.
   Abandonment issues develop in childhood and are related to physical or emotional neglect and loss. Children need unconditional love and nurture. The loss of a parent through divorce, prolonged separation, or death can result in abandonment issues. A child who is emotionally abandoned may have one or both parents in the home but receive little love, guidance, warmth, approval, or emotional support from them. A child who is physically neglected by parents grows up alone, helpless, and rejected. Neglect and loss cause intense emotions, which become part of the child’s personality. Neglect and loss in childhood can result in individuals who are always on the lookout for signs of being abandoned. Adults with abandonment issues are extremely insecure and sensitive.
   Symptoms of abandonment include the following categories and examples:

desperation to remain close, needing constant reassurance of approval, an excessive need for affection and attention.
Use of threats of self-harm or rejection to continue the relationship.






Abilify is part of a class of drugs called atypical antipsychotics. They are called “atypical” because of their relatively lower risk of certain adverse side effects compared to traditional antipsychotic drugs. Abilify is useful in the short-term treatment of acute psychotic and acute manic states, as well as agitation in dementia. It is also used in the long-term treatment of chronic psychotic disorders. Abilify is thought to work by influencing dopamine, the neurotransmitter (chemical messengers) that affects movement and balance. Abilify appears to bind to dopamine receptors in the brain and prevent dopamine from fully activating them. This differs from traditional antipsychotics, which completely block dopamine receptors. Besides resulting in some relief of psychotic symptoms, these conventional drugs can cause severe movement side effects, called extrapyramidal symptoms, which Abilify does not.


Abilify may increase the risk for diabetes, so those who are taking it and develop extreme thirst, frequent urination, or other diabetes symptoms should consult a physician. Women who are pregnant, intend to become pregnant, or are nursing should talk to their physician before beginning or discontinuing Abilify. There is increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms, and withdrawal symptoms in newborns whose mothers took Abilify during their third trimester of pregnancy. Because Abilify can cause drowsiness and impair judgment and motor skills, individuals are advised not to operate a motor vehicle or machinery. Since it has a sedative effect, alcohol use should be limited when taking Abilify. Because Abilify can affect the body’s ability to regulate temperature, potentially leading to overheating and dehydration, those taking it should be
cautious when exercising.



Abuse is the intentional physical, psychological, or sexual maltreatment of an individual.

Abuse is any action that intentionally harms or injures an individual. There are several types of abuse. These include neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, elder abuse, and psychological abuse. Substance abuse is another type of abuse. All forms of abuse in the United States are illegal and carry criminal penalties. A brief overview of the common forms of abuse across the lifespan follows.



Child abuse is a crime that all health and social service professionals are mandated to report. It takes various forms. The four main types are neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional abuse. The 2010 Child Maltreatment Report (NCANDS) found that neglect was the most common form of child abuse. It accounted for 78.3% of cases. By comparison, physical abuse accounted for 17.6% of cases. Sexual abuse accounted for 9.2% of cases, while psychological abuse accounted for 8.1% of cases. Adverse childhood experiences such as childhood sexual abuse may significantly impact the individual’s health in adulthood. Sexual abuse. “Sexual abuse” refers to nonconsensual sexual behavior between two adults, between an adult and child, or between two children, one of whom is forcefully dominant or significantly older. Sexual behaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and buttocks while the victim is either dressed or undressed. Sexual abuse is also a reportable crime. Domestic violence. Domestic violence involves abuse of an individual by another with whom the victim is living, has lived with, or is in a significant relationship. It is also known as domestic abuse, spousal abuse, battering, family violence, and intimate partner violence. It also includes rape. It can involve physical, psychological, and/or sexual abuse, including rape. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence estimates that 1 in 5 women and 1 in 33 men will be the victim of a rape or an attempted rape during their
lifetime.
Like child abuse, elder abuse is also a reportable crime. It can also involve emotional abuse, neglect, physical abuse, or sexual abuse. Often, more than one type of abuse occurs. It is committed by caretakers and may occur in the home or in a residential facility. The National Center on Elder Abuse reported that in 2013 nearly 6 million cases of elder abuse were reported.



Acute stress disorder is a mental disorder characterized by recurrent and upsetting thoughts, inability to sleep or concentrate, or dissociation following a traumatic event.


Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing



maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as CBT.
• Cognitive restructuring is a psychotherapy technique for identifying maladaptive (unhealthy) thoughts and changing them to present a more accurate view of a situation.
• Dissociation is a mental state in which the integrated functioning of an individual’s identity is significantly disrupted or changed.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Exposure therapy is a behavior therapy intervention (method) in which a client is exposed to a feared object or situation. It is also referred to as flooding.
• Mood is an individual’s subjective emotional experience.
• Pessimism is a way of relating to one’s world where the future is expected to hold more negative than positive outcomes.
• Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder characterized by nightmares, irritability, anxiety, emotional numbing, and recurrent flashbacks of a traumatic event that an individual experienced or witnessed. It is also referred to as PTSD.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Trauma is a singular or recurrent event that is both extraordinary and severely distressing. It is also called traumatic event.
• Trauma and stressor-related disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by exposure to a traumatic or stressful event. These include post-traumatic stress disorder, reactive attachment disorder, and acute stress disorder.
Description and Diagnosis
Acute stress disorder is one of the DSM-5 trauma and stressor-related disorders. This disorder follows a traumatic event and is characterized by inability to experience positive emotions, recurrent and upsetting thoughts, inability to sleep or concentrate, avoidance of situations similar to the trauma, and dissociation. Traumatic events that cause this disorder include being subjected to attack, mugging, rape, robbery, murder, natural disaster, terrorism, war, or catastrophic accident. This disorder is similar to post-traumatic stress disorder and is often confused with it. Both disorders are distinguishable by the duration of symptoms, with the symptoms of acute stress disorder lasting less than one month.
   Those with this disorder often reexperience the event with accompanying distressing symptoms. This trauma can include direct experience as well as witnessing trauma. Consequently, emergency responders and hospital staff often suffer from this disorder. The severity of the disorder increases if the event is a purposeful act that violates the individual directly and is further worsened by the degree of severity of the incident itself. Individuals who manifest this disorder are likely to experience intrusive and recurrent thoughts related to the traumatic event. These thoughts may also include guilt as a consequence of being unable to prevent trauma inflicted on another. These thoughts may also be expressed in dreams, including thematic elements from the event. Individuals may avoid places or things associated with the event. These individuals may be very reactive, irritable, or temperamental. They might also be anxious and hypervigilant of threats. The stress symptoms might be worsened by exposure to stimuli that is similar to those associated with the traumatic event. The prevalence of this disorder is relatively high following traumatic events. In cases of trauma that do not involve personal violations, it is estimated that slightly less than one in every five individuals will experience acute stress disorder. In cases that do involve personal violation, the proportion increases to between 20% and 50% of individuals. Acute stress disorder is more common in females, probably because of the increased likelihood of physical violations such as rape. Other risk factors include a high level of worry, pessimism, and living or working in environments where
  



trauma is likely to occur such as a war zone or emergency room (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they are exposed to a traumatic event and exhibit associated symptoms. These associated symptoms might include avoiding situation similar to that of the trauma, inability to experience positive emotions following the event, recurrent and upsetting thoughts about the event, inability to sleep or concentrate, and dissociation. When dissociation is present, symptoms may manifest as flashbacks where the individual relives the traumatic event or the inability to recall aspects of the event. These dissociative symptoms are also associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and are often confused. These two disorders are distinguishable by the duration of symptoms. If symptoms are present for less than one month, then acute stress disorder is applicable. Once symptoms have been present for one or more months, the appropriate diagnosis is post-traumatic stress disorder. It is also important to note that individuals cannot be diagnosed with acute stress

Addiction
disorder if they have only become aware of a trauma
they must have experienced or

observed the trauma directly. Also, those with traumatic brain injury may exhibit symptoms of acute stress disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is twofold. In part, it can be attributed to the traumatic event itself. However, certain attributes may play a role in the manifestation of this disorder in individuals who are more susceptible to this and other mental disorders. These attributes include having been exposed to past traumas, one’s belief that one can influence outcome of one’s life, and the unique meaning the individual gives to the traumatic event. As with most psychological disorders, research on the cause this disorder is ongoing.

ASD is usually treated with psychotherapy. The most common form of therapy utilized is cognitive behavior therapy. Specific interventions (techniques) may include exposure techniques and cognitive restructuring. Prompt use of psychotherapy is critical to inhibit the development of the more severe and often chronic condition, post-traumatic stress disorder.

Addiction is the compulsive use of a habit-forming substance or the irresistible urge to engage in a behavior despite harmful consequences.

• Addictive disorder is a mental disorder that involves compulsive and uncontrolled pursuit of reward or relief with substance use or other compulsive behaviors.
• Behavioral addiction is a form of addiction caused by the compulsion to repeatedly engage in a behavior that causes harmful consequences. It is also referred to as process addiction or non-substance-related addiction.
• Craving is a strong desire for more of a substance or behavior (sex, shopping, Internet use) in order to experience a euphoric effect or to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
• Dependence is the need for a drug to function normally. Dependence can be psychological and/or physical. Psychological dependence is





dependence on a psychoactive substance for the reward it provides. “Physical dependence” refers to the unpleasant physiological symptoms if the drug is stopped.
• Detoxification is a process of purging the body of the toxic effects of a drug or substance. During this process the symptoms of withdrawal are also treated. Also called detox, it is the first step in drug treatment program.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Psychoactive refers to a drug or other substance that produces mood changes and distorted perceptions.
• Relapse is the recurrence of symptoms after a period of improvement or recovery.
• Substance-related and addictive disorders are a group of mental disorders that include substance disorders characterized by physiological dependence, drug-seeking behavior, tolerance, and social withdrawal. This group also includes the non-substance disorder of gambling.
• Tolerance refers to the need for higher doses of a substance or more frequent engagement in a behavior to achieve the same effect.
• Twelve-Step group is a self-help group whose members attempt recovery from various addictions and compulsions based on a plan called the Twelve Steps.
• Withdrawal is the unpleasant and potentially life-threatening physiological changes that occur due to the discontinuation of certain drugs after prolonged regular use.
Treatment often begins in specialized addiction treatment programs and clinics. These programs involve various treatment methods that focus on detoxification, reducing cravings, and preventing relapse. Common to many programs are Twelve-Step groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. The prognosis for recovery from any addiction depends on the substance or behavior and the individual’s personality and circumstances. Relapse is common, and those with addictions often make repeated attempts to quit before they are successful. Users of more than one drug typically have the more challenges in recovering from their addictions.


Addiction counseling is therapy provided to people who are dependent on the use of one or more substances or activities.

• Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain which involves compulsive and uncontrolled pursuit of reward or relief with substance use or other compulsive behaviors.
• Addiction recovery is the state of abstinence from addictive behaviors, usually achieved through self-reflection and spiritual exploration.
• Relapse is the recurrence of symptoms after a period of improvement or recovery.
• Sober means not consuming alcohol and drugs or engaging in other addictive activities.


The American Medical Association defines addiction as a chronic disease with physical and emotional factors that impair control over the use of substances. Some examples of substances and activities people can become addicted to are alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling, and the Internet. For addiction counselors, working with people who are substance dependent or abusive is difficult because of a high rate of relapse, defensiveness, and a lack of research as how to best treat the conditions. The addiction counselor offers a different view and believes the problem of addiction is how you respond or fail to respond to substances and treatment. Addiction counseling rests on the idea that alcohol and drug problems become independent of their beginnings.
   In counseling training, students have been taught to remove their own experience from the client’s recovery processes. In addiction counseling there is more of a demand for personal involvement than seen in other counseling professions. Providing hope is a crucial dimension for addiction counselors as they offer themselves as “living proof” of hope. It is important to model the potential for long-term recovery through their own story and by guiding the client to a community of people in recovery.
   Addiction counselors are exposed to many frustrations and losses. First, there is a high mortality rate of substance abusers. Many counselors use these experiences to deepen their understanding of the nature of addiction




and to recommit themselves to finding new ways to reach their clients. Addiction counselors are aware that their clients are often involved in a life or death struggle for recovery. The stakes involved in this work are high and awareness brings its own burdens and rewards.
   There are several rituals that are considered best practice for addiction counselors. These activities include rituals such as prayer, meditation, and self-reflection. Also included are mirroring rituals like reaching out to others for support and inspiration. Acts of self-care for the body and mind are also important for addiction counselors. Lastly, unpaid acts of service such as serving as a sponsor or giving back to the recovery community are valued.


As early as 1774, the effects of alcohol abuse were known to be devastating. Substance-related problems in the United States began with the attack on Native Americans in the 18th and 19th centuries. Treatments for these problems at the time included use of native medicines, religion, and limiting its use and availability. Addiction counseling started as a grassroots recovery community. Therapy with this population began in 1913 at a church in Boston with religious leaders called the Oxford Group. However, most laypeople believe that alcohol and drug treatment did not begin until the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in 1935. Bill Wilson and Bob Smith used the Oxford Group as a model when they founded AA with a shift away from religion. AA viewed alcoholics as having an allergy to alcohol, which formed the basis of the disease or medical model. This was a change in the view of alcoholism, which had previously been viewed as a moral weakness. Soon after AA was founded, members began to be employed at substance abuse treatment centers.
   they simply went through a detoxification process. This usually occurred in their local hospital, and from there most were referred to AA meetings. Supporters of AA and other Twelve-Step groups, believe it is the most effective way of treating addiction and should be the primary treatment program. Accordingly, it became the norm that clients needing help with alcoholism or substance abuse were


referred to. This often was recommended instead of professional help or as an add-on to addiction counseling treatment.
   In the 1940s it became clear that a definition and formalization of the addiction counselor should occur. The next major event in the treatment and counseling of alcoholics and other drug abusers was the opening of the Hazelden Treatment Center in Minnesota in 1949. Hazelden developed what later became known as the Minnesota Model. This model includes a combination of therapy, spirituality, group treatment, and the Twelve Steps. At Hazelden they integrated recovering, nonprofessionally trained counselors as part of the alcoholism treatment team. In 1954 addiction counselors were provided a professional role in Minnesota and other states later followed. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reports that today most residential treatment centers are a variation of the Minnesota Model.



Currently, AA has over 115,000 independent groups throughout the world, with over 2,100,000 members (Alcoholics Anonymous, 2010). In the field of substance abuse there are three main approaches to addiction counseling. The traditional approach is the disease model which treats the addiction in the same medical model as other conditions. The research approach seeks the scientifically supported methods to treatment. And last, the managed care approach wants to identify the greatest benefit for the least cost.
   These three movements conflict with one another, resulting in unrest among professional addiction counselors. The medical model believes in dependency where the research approach finds there is not enough evidence to support the claim. The managed care approach is unlikely to pay for anything that is highly disputed among professionals. Therefore, the conflicts in the field have led to difficulty in uniting and identifying common goals in addiction counseling.









such as alcohol or drugs, or behaviors such as gambling or Internet use? For years there has been considerable debate over whether there is actually an “addictive personality.” Several books and articles in newspapers and magazines suggest that there is, in fact, such a personality.
   But research, to date, has yet to confirm the existence of the addictive personality. Notable is a study sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences by Lang (1983). It concluded that there is no single set of psychological traits that characterized proneness to the various addictions. However, the study

		did identify several common elements among those

• Addiction is the persistent, compulsive dependence on a substance or a behavior for coping with unmanageable conflict and stress.
• Antisocial personality is a mental condition characterized by a pattern of disregarding and violating the rights of others.
• Self-control is the capacity for self-discipline. Some use this term interchangeably with willpower.
• Willpower is the ability to resist a short-term temptations in order to achieve a long-term goal. It also involves the ability to delay gratification. Some use this term interchangeably with self-control.


Several factors influence the development of addiction. These include biological, environmental (social), and psychological factors. Of the psychological factors, personality traits are considered important in understanding why certain individuals seem to be more prone to developing an addiction than others. The question has been, why do some individuals develop a physical and psychological dependence on substances

with various addictions. Individuals prone to addiction are more likely to engage in impulsive behavior and sensation (thrill) seeking and have difficulty with self-control, willpower, and delaying gratification. They tend to value nonconformity and have little commitment to socially value goals for achievement. They are also likely to be socially alienated, tolerate deviance, and have an antisocial personality. Finally, they commonly experience considerable stress but lack sufficient coping skills to deal with that stress. Lang suggested that this element helps to explain why drug and alcohol problems are highest during high periods of stress. For most individuals, adolescence and other stressful life transitions are the most stressful periods.
   While there is insufficient research support for concept of the addictive personality, those with addiction seem to share certain commonalities. The value of identifying and further researching these common elements is twofold. First, they can help in predicting proneness to addiction. Second, they can help in devising better treatments for those with addiction.







Adjustment disorder is a mental disorder characterized by short-term emotional distress or behavioral problems following a stressful event.


• Acute stress disorder is a mental disorder that affects individuals who have been exposed either directly or indirectly to a traumatic situation such as death, rape, or serious bodily harm. Those suffering from this disorder often reexperience the event with accompanying distressing symptoms.
• Anxiety is a negative emotional state characterized by feelings of nervousness, worry, and apprehension about an imagined danger.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.
• Culture is the common beliefs, customs, and behaviors of a particular group, society, or nation.
• Depression is an emotional state characterized by feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, guilt, or reduced ability to enjoy life. It is not considered a mental disorder unless it significantly disrupts one’s daily functioning.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Family therapy is a type of psychotherapy for families that focuses on improving


• Mindfulness practices are intentional activities that foster living in the present moment and awareness that is nonjudgmental and accepting.
• Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder characterized by nightmares, irritability, anxiety, emotional numbing, and recurrent flashbacks of a traumatic event that an individual experienced or witnessed. It is also referred to as PTSD.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Trauma- and stressor-related disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by exposure to a traumatic or stressful event. These include post-traumatic stress disorder, reactive attachment disorder, and disinhibited social engagement disorder.

Adjustment disorder is one of the trauma and stress-related disorders as expressed in the DSM-5. This disorder is a common, short-term mental disorder characterized by difficulty coping with a significant but nontraumatic stressor. Individuals with this disorder are likely to experience emotional distress, difficulty in social or work settings, or both. An important aspect of this disorder is that the symptoms manifested are disproportionate to what might be normally expected following the stressful event. This may seem a simple task, but it can be a difficult assessment for a clinician to make. What qualifies for disproportionate varies significantly by a number of factors including culture, age, and personal history. Adjustment disorder is often associated with close personal relationships and financial, employment, or business issues. The symptoms of this disorder typically appear immediately following certain events such as news of a layoff. In contrast, this disorder may develop over the course of days or





weeks following the finalization of a divorce. Adjustment disorder is most likely to manifest as psychological symptoms in adults and behavioral symptoms (e.g., defiance, fighting, and vandalism) in adolescents.
   Adjustment disorder is common in mental health settings. It is estimated that adjustment disorder is present in 5%–20% of those treated in mental health settings but can be as high as 50%. This disorder is more likely to occur in individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if the following criteria are met. There must be an identifiable stressor followed by related symptoms. These symptoms must arise within three months. These symptoms must be related to a disproportionate level of emotional distress, disturbance in social or work-related functioning, or both. If the symptoms persist for longer than six months following the end of the stressor, then a different diagnosis is appropriate. Also, adjustment disorder is differentiated by the types of symptoms present; some individuals may indicate that they feel depressed, anxious, or both. Some individuals may have disturbances in conduct, while others may have conduct disturbance combined with depressed mood and/or anxiety (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Adjustment disorder differs from both acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in that the stressor does not involve threat of unnatural death, personal violation, or significant bodily harm. Specifically, adjustment disorder follows a life event that is in some way meaningful to the individual. Also, differing cultures maintain differing expectations pertaining to one’s reactions to particular life events. Consequently, a clinician must carefully consider these expectations in his or her assessment of what reaction might be normally expected. For example, an individual from a collectivist (family-focused) culture may exhibit significantly more distress following a family crisis than someone from an individualistic ( personal-focus) culture.
The cause of this disorder is a combination of the
stressor and a number of personal factors. Like most mental disorders, the exact etiology (cause) is unclear,
although it is believed to be a combination of genetics and environmental factors. However, the culture of the individual plays a significant role in the meaning given to the stressor by the individuals. Therefore, the cultural context in which this disorder occurs is very important to ascertain in each case.

This disorder is usually treated with psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is most often aimed at reducing symptoms and improving any inhibited functioning that has resulted from this disorder. Specific forms of psychotherapy used in the treatment of this disorder may include family therapy, mindfulness practices, and cognitive behavior therapy. Individuals who develop depressive or anxiety symptoms may also be treated with medications, although this is not a preferred practice considering the short-term duration of symptoms. Self-help books and support groups are also common forms of informal treatment. Typically, these books and groups are specific to the stressor. For example, an individual suffering from adjustment disorder following divorce might read a self-help book about divorce or attend a support group with other divorcees.




Allostatic load is the by-product of chronic stress over time. It is a result of allostasis, which is the process of maintaining balance in the body through physiological (physical) changes.


• Adrenaline is a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) involved in the fight or flight response that increases heart rate, pulse rate, and blood pressure.
• Brain is the organ at the center of the nervous system. It is responsible for a wide range of functions, including learning, movement, and regulation of the body.
• Dopamine is the chemical messenger in the brain responsible for coordinating the movement of voluntary muscle groups. It also regulates attention, pleasure, and coping with stress.
• Hormones are chemicals in the body that are produced by glands to regulate physical functions like sleep, metabolism, and mood. Cortisol and testosterone are examples of hormones.
• Neurotransmitters are chemicals in the brain responsible for a variety of functions, including pleasure, motivation, and mood. Dopamine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid are examples of neurotransmitters.
• Stress is the pattern of specific and nonspecific responses to events that tax or exceed an individual’s ability to cope. Stress can be acute or chronic .
• Stress management is a set of psychological techniques for increasing the capacity to better cope with psychological stress. It usually includes relaxation methods.


Allostasis is the process of maintaining balance in an organism through physiological adjustments in
response to environmental stimuli. The term literally means “maintaining stability through change.” These changes are controlled by the brain through the release of hormones and neurotransmitters. They are intended to meet the expected demands of the individual. One example is epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. It is secreted by the adrenal gland when an individual perceives danger or experiences excitement. Adrenaline results in increased heart rate, respiration rate, and blood glucose levels. Cortisol is another stress hormone. It increases energy production in the body and suppresses the immune system. Neurotransmitters like dopamine are also released in response to stress. They act to increase concentration, motivation, and memory. All of these changes enhance performance and enable quick movements such as running or fighting. They involve many different regulatory systems in the body, such as the central nervous system and the inflammatory system. Once the perceived danger or excitement has passed, neurochemical levels decrease and the systems return to normal. This physiological process has clear short-term benefits. For example, being chased by a rabid dog would activate the stress response system and allow an individual to escape. Increased blood flow would enable faster movements and heightened awareness would lead to quick decision making. However, the long-term effects of stress can result in damage to the body and lead to disease.
The term “allostatic load” was originally used by biologist Bruce McEwen, PhD (1938), and psychologist Eliot Stellar, PhD (1919–1993). They defined it as the by-product of chronic stress over time. It can be thought of as the price the body pays for constantly adapting to stress through allostasis. The neurochemical changes that accompany stress can negatively impact functioning if they occur frequently. While some stressful situations may happen on occasion, repeated activation of the stress response system may result from other environmental factors. For example, living in poverty can produce significant ongoing stress. Problems like insufficient food, large debt, and loss of a job can activate the body’s stress response system. Unlike a chance encounter with a rabid dog, however, these environmental stressors do not quickly pass. Constant arousal leads to dysregulation (imbalance) of the body’s stress response. An individual’s allostatic load can be measured.
This measure includes factors such as cortisol levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol. High allostatic load scores have been associated with a number of mental and physical problems. These include increased risk of heart disease, impaired immune system, memory problems, and increased risk of death. Individuals who experience chronic stress are at risk for these conditions. An individual’s response to stress depends on many factors like genetics, environment, and coping skills. There are ways to reduce the negative impact of stress through the use of techniques like stress management.



Amnesia is the inability to recall past events or retain new information. It usually occurs as a result of physical or psychological trauma.


• Alzheimer’s disease is a mental disorder characterized by amnesia and the decline of cognitive functions. It causes significant distress or impaired functioning in daily activities.
• Anterograde amnesia is the loss of memory that followed the causal event.
• Cognitive pertains to mental abilities and processes.
• Dementia is a loss of memory and mental ability that is sufficiently severe to interfere with normal activities of daily living.
• Dissociative amnesia is a mental disorder that involves amnesia and that causes significant distress or impaired functioning.




• Retrograde amnesia is the loss of memory that precedes the causal event.
• Transient global amnesia is a form of anterograde amnesia that is intense and short term and presents with no other symptoms.
• Traumatic brain injury is an insult or injury to the brain from an external force. In DSM-5, this disorder is known as Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury.


Amnesia is the inability to recall important personal information that is different from ordinary forgetting (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Individuals suffering from amnesia are likely to present firstly for the event that caused the amnesia. Consequently, they are likely to be encountered in a medical or crisis setting. In addition, amnesia can occur in other neurological or medical concerns and is not likely to be the primary diagnosis. Some individuals may exhibit a total inability to recall events leading up to the precipitating event. Others might exhibit profound forgetfulness or seem as if they very confused. Amnesia may last hours, weeks, years, or, in rare cases, a lifetime.
   There are three kinds of amnesia: anterograde amnesia, retrograde amnesia, and transient global amnesia. Typically, retrograde amnesia does not involve a total loss of memory but is variable in regard to the period of memory loss preceding its onset. Transient global amnesia is often associated with physical or emotional stress. 
With psychological amnesia, the impairment is often attributed to assault, death of a loved one, or other disturbing event. Amnesia can also be caused by other medical conditions.


Treatment begins with a thorough assessment to assess memory loss and identify likely causes. There is no direct treatment for amnesia. The primary goal of treatment is to resolve the underlying cause. That is to say if the amnesia is caused by traumatic brain injury, then it is the injury that is treated. Alternatively, if the cause is psychological trauma, then the psychological intervention will be aimed at helping the individual resolve the psychological issue directly in the hope that the amnesia will resolve as a consequence. A secondary goal is to increase the individual’s capacity to better cope, enhance memory, and provide psychological support for these individuals and their families.






• Tic is a sudden involuntary behavior that is difficult or impossible for the person to suppress. Tics may be either motor (related to movement) or vocal (inappropriate language) and tend to be more pronounced under stress.
• Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by tics, including multiple involuntary movements and uncontrollable vocalizations.



“Amphetamine” is the name of a class of drugs that stimulate the central nervous system. They produce their effects by altering chemicals that transmit nerve messages in the body. Amphetamines are used in the treatment of depression, obesity, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and Tourette’s syndrome. Brand names of commonly prescribed amphetamines are Biphetamine, Dexampex, Desoxyn, Ferndex, Methampex, Oxydess II, and Spancap. Generic names of amphetamines include amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine. Stimulants used in the treatment of ADHD are methylphenidate (trade name: Ritalin), mixed amphetamine salts (trade name: Adderall), and dextroamphetamine (trade name: Dexedrine). Since most of these drugs tend to be short-acting, it is usually necessary to take several doses a day to maintain the therapeutic effect. Longer-acting versions of these drugs, such as Ritalin LA and Adderall XR, permit once or twice a day dosing. Amphetamines are usually given orally and their effects can last up to 20 hours.

Because they are highly addictive, they should be prescribed only after other therapeutic approaches have failed. They should be used with great caution in children under three years of age and for anyone with a history of elevated blood pressure and those with tics and Tourette’s syndrome. Also, those with a history of an overactive thyroid should not take amphetamines, nor should those with moderate-to-severe high blood pressure, glaucoma, or psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Also, those with a history of


drug abuse, psychomotor agitation, or cardiovascular disease should not use amphetamines.
   Caution is needed in the use of amphetamines in young children because of concerns about the possibility of sudden death or retarded growth. A small number of deaths have been reported, and some studies indicate that taking stimulants can slow growth rate in children. As a result some physicians recommend drug holidays in which the drug is temporarily stopped during times that require less focus or self-discipline, such as weekends or a summer vacation. Studies indicate that the adverse effects on growth rate are eliminated by these drug holidays.
   For adults, amphetamine use should not be discontinued suddenly. Rather, the dose should be lowered gradually and then discontinued under the supervision of a physician. Generally these drugs should be taken early in the day so as not to interfere with sleep at night. Hazardous activities should be avoided until the person’s condition has been stabilized with medication. The use of amphetamines during pregnancy has been associated with fetal growth retardation, premature birth, and heart and brain abnormalities.
   Amphetamines can cause considerable side effects and may be toxic in large doses. The most common side effects associated with amphetamines are irregular heartbeat, increased heart rate or blood pressure, dizziness, insomnia, restlessness, headache, shakiness, dry mouth, metallic taste, diarrhea, constipation, and weight loss. Other side effects can include changes in sexual drive, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, chills, depression, irritability, and indigestion. High doses, whether for medical purposes or illicit ones, can cause addiction, dependence, increased aggression, and, in some cases, psychotic episodes.










“Anger” refers to the external behaviors and internal emotional, physiological, and cognitive processes a person experiences when feeling angry.

Anger is one of the most common human emotions and is a combination of a person’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in response to a stimulus. Anger serves the purpose of enabling an individual to recognize problems and take action.
   Anger is considered an adaptive and constructive emotion when it is employed to maintain positive relationships, assert appropriate authority, or promote change. For example, if someone sees a student being bullied, the observer will first become aware of the problem by the emotional feelings, physical sensations, and thoughts associated with anger. The observer’s heart rate increases and muscles tense; the observer may feel a sense of heat flushing his or her face. The observer has the thought of how unfair or hurtful the bullying is and that he or she must stop it. Emotionally the observer feels compassion and anger. This experience is often referred to as “righteous indignation.” “Righteous indignation” refers to anger resulting from a perception of mistreatment, injustice, or malice. These feelings may lead to a behavioral response that is used to stop the bullying.

Physical sensations of anger included muscle tension such as fist clenching or teeth grinding, body temperature change, and sweating. When cartoon characters are depicted as angry, they turn red, steam begins shooting out of their ears, and they clench their fist and grimace. Although these depictions are cartoonish they do illustrate some of the physical body responses to anger. Common verbal expressions of anger include “it makes my blood boil,, “I wanted to explode,” and “I went off on somebody.”
   Anger encompasses a wide range of emotional experiences from being mildly annoyed to intense rage. The emotional state of anger is highly associated with thoughts and behaviors. There are three components of anger that are used to determine if a person has an anger problem: frequency, intensity, and duration. Frequency refers to how often a person is angered, intensity refers to how angry a
person becomes, and duration refers to how long the anger lasts.
   Anger is considered dysfunctional when behaviors become malicious or spiteful and the individual seeks to hurt the offender or get revenge. Verbal abusiveness such as yelling, screaming, name-calling, and making threats are examples of verbal anger behaviors. Pushing, blocking, hitting, and breaking things are examples of physically abusive behaviors. Other anger behaviors include hand gestures, facial expressions, spitting, and other body language expressions. Functional or healthy anger expression is related to the psychological capacity of emotional regulation. Being able to regulate one’s emotions is positively associated with health outcomes, relationships, academic performance, and successful problem solving.
   How we think about an event determines how we feel about it. How we think about an event is called an “appraisal.” Appraisals determine the initial intensity and general positive or negative functionality of the emotion. Repetitive or constant thinking about a negative event is called “rumination.” People who ruminate can’t “let it go”; they “stew over it” and are unable to “get over it.” “Reappraisal” is actively changing the way in which one thinks about an event.
   Researchers who study anger have determined that how a person appraises, or thinks about an event, determines the person’s emotional response to the event. People who ruminate and do not change or modify how they think about the event stay angry or increase their anger and aggressive behaviors. People who reappraise events, thus changing how they think about the event, decrease both the intensity of the experience and the duration of the emotional upset.

Because there is such a wide range of anger experience and expression, including appropriate expressions of anger such as frustration or annoyance, anger in and of itself is not a diagnosable disorder. Anger is included as a symptom in several disorders listed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), including oppositional defiant,





post-traumatic stress, and some personality disorders. There is a recognized disorder titled “intermittent explosive disorder” in which the central feature is repeated behavioral anger-based aggressive outburst. Diagnosis is made depending on the intensity of the verbal and physical aggression and frequency of the aggressive outburst. These outbursts are impulsive (not planned) and are grossly out of proportion to the stressing event. The outbursts are recurrent and cause either considerable distress in the individual or significant problems at work and with his or her personal relationships. The core feature of the disorder is failure to control impulsive aggressive behaviors in response to events that would not typically result in aggressive outburst.
   Individuals who have experienced physical and emotional trauma, alcoholism, and domestic violence while growing up are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder. Treatments are available, including individual and group talking therapies. Although there are no medications directly prescribed for anger control, some drug therapies have beneficial effects in treating underlying mood disorders.
   Anger is one of the most common of human emotions. When unregulated, the emotional and behaviors components of anger can lead to significant problems in maintaining healthy relationships and social functioning. When managed by reappraisals, anger can become a healthy and productive emotion leading to positive relationships and social change.


Anger management describes the process of acquiring skills to recognize signs that one is becoming angry and take action to deal with the emotion in a productive, healthy way.

“Anger management” refers to a set of psychological, therapeutic techniques and exercises that a person can use to deal with anger in an effective manner. This process involves recognizing triggers and calming oneself down before the situation escalates. Anger management is suggested for people who are unable to control their anger or manage anger appropriately once it surfaces. The purpose of an anger management strategy is to learn to deal with anger in a positive, healthy way. These skills can be taught to oneself through the use of books or other resources or be learned in an anger management class taught by a mental health professional.

Anger is a natural human emotion. Everyone experiences anger at one time or another. Physical well-being can be negatively impacted by anger. Research indicates that anger can increase a person’s chances of developing heart disease. This risk is higher for men than women. Anger is linked to other physical problems as well, such as insomnia, digestive issues, and headaches. However, anger can also have survival benefits—it serves as part of our brain’s fight or flight response to perceived threat or harm. Anger should be expressed, though, in appropriate ways. An anger management approach teaches a person to cope with anger rather than suppress it. Acceptance, acknowledgment, and truth are an important part of an anger management approach. One must also be taught to recognize signs of anger. These include physical symptoms that signify that anger may be building. Examples may include increased heart rate, increased body temperature, reddening of the face, clenched fists, tightening of the jaw, and quickening of the breath. Identifying stressors is another integral piece in this process as stress can be caused by different factors such as work, family, or health.





   A person may himself or herself recognize that he or she has anger management issues, or this may be suggested to the person by a family member or friend. In more severe cases, a person may be mandated to attend anger management classes by the legal system, often resulting from the inability to control one’s anger in a previous situation. Anger management strategies can be practiced alone, one on one, in a small group, or in a class setting. These sessions are typically led by a psychologist or other trained mental health professional. Depending on a person’s needs and the circumstances and severity of the problem, these sessions can last from weeks to months to even longer. If a person has other mental health issues, this can also adversely affect treatment. Some of these conditions include a history of substance abuse, depression, anxiety, and/or social disorders such as Asperger’s syndrome. Other factors that can impact success are lack of self-care (nutrition, sleep, exercise) and stress. Common techniques employed in anger management training

include relaxation, guided imagery, deep-breathing, stress management, problem solving, conflict resolution, cognitive behavior therapy, and solution-focused strategies.
   Certain steps encompass most anger management programs. One, the participant learns his or her anger triggers and notes situations where these are likely to cause anger to arise. Two, the participant recognizes physical signs and symptoms that signify that anger is building. Three, the participant employs anger management strategies in order to calm down and control his or her anger. Last, the participant learns to deal with the situation in a positive, healthy way and express feelings and needs in order to solve the problem effectively.


No anger disorders are listed in the DSM-5. Most research conducted on anger management surround its use with persons who suffer from anxiety and depression. These strategies are related to psychological treatment for these disorders. Effective interventions for anger management support a cognitive behavioral approach. Accepting personal responsibility and being conscious and in control of negative thought patters are key aspects of this type of therapy.

Animal-assisted therapy is a goal-directed therapy that involves the presence of or interaction with an animal as a fundamental part of a client’s treatment.


Animal-assisted therapy is used for a number of different conditions. These can range from problems involving emotional distress to anxiety-related symptoms and disorders. Therapy dogs are the most common although a wide variety of animals are now being used. Other animals involved in these types of interventions include horses and dolphins.
   There are references in history to the therapeutic presence of animals for medical problems, especially psychological ones. After World War II, animal-assisted therapy began to be a subject of serious consideration, especially with medical professionals who were working with children. It was found that animals could serve as catalysts or mediators of human social interaction. It can expedite both the process of socialization and learning as well as helping with building rapport between patients and therapists.
   There are two things that distinguish animal-assisted therapy from the simple presence of animals in therapy. First, the intervention involves the intentional presence or use of an animal and a psychological





or medical professional delivers the therapy. This professional is required to practice within the scope of his or her professional training and expertise. In order to be successful, animal-assisted therapy must be carefully directed and the animals must be carefully chosen and often trained to be able to participate in treatment.


Ancient literature and tradition stated that being licked by a dog was curative. Since then the use of comfort or support animals has been recognized for some time. Florence Nightingale, for example, made the first mention of it in the 1800s. But it is only more recently that the value of such animal-assisted therapy for treatment of conditions like mental health disorders has been acknowledged.
   Sigmund Freud, one of the fathers of psychology, noticed the calming effect his dog had on his patients when his dog was in the room during sessions. In modern times Boris Levinson introduced the practice of animal-assisted therapy and the first complete work in the field through his book. In 1977, Sam and Elizabeth Corson opened the first pet-assisted therapy program at a psychiatric unit at Ohio State University.
   Alan Beck and Aaron Katcher began their work documenting the direct changes in the physical responses of patients in the presence of a friendly dog. They found that patient’s breathing became more regular, heartbeat slowed, and muscles relaxed. These symptoms suggest lowering of the nervous system and therefore stress. Animal-assisted therapy began with dogs but has grown to popularly include equine, or horse, and dolphin-assisted therapies.


The popularity of animal-assisted therapies is growing. New programs emerge frequently, and an increasing variety of animals are being used for this therapy. Use of therapy animals has highlighted the positive benefits of touch in counseling. Therapy animals provide a nonjudgmental space for individuals to work out their problems in a way that can include nonthreaten-ing touch.


   From a therapeutic perspective, there has been a lot of work done in order to agree on methodological standards and strategies that help establish the scientific evidence base for the efficacy of animal-assisted therapies. In the early 2000s handbooks and research articles began to be published on this topic. As best practices emerge, the practice of animal-assisted therapy has gained more credibility among other more traditional treatments in counseling and therapy.




Anorexia nervosa is a mental disorder characterized by refusal to maintain minimal normal body weight along with a fear of weight gain and a distorted body image.


• Binge eating is a pattern of disordered eating consisting of episodes of uncontrolled intake of food.
• Bulimia nervosa is a mental disorder characterized by recurrent binge eating with loss of control over one’s eating and compensation for eating.
• Eating disorder is a class of mental disorders that are characterized by difficulties with too much, too little, or unhealthy food intake, and may include distorted body image.






Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is diagnosed when an individual displays a body weight significantly below what is normal or expected for the individual’s current age and height. The individual is preoccupied with self-image and appears to be in denial regarding the severity of weight loss. The individual presents with distorted perceptions regarding his or her body (distorted body image). The individual believes he or she has “fat thighs” or a “fat stomach” when he or she actually lacks appropriate body mass, meaning that the individual is too thin. The extreme weight loss in anorexia nervosa is due to the individual’s fear of gaining weight. The body mass index (BMI) is used to indicate the severity of the disorder with ranges from mild to extreme. There are two subtype patterns of anorexia nervosa; one is restricting food intake, while the other is bingeing and purging. The subtypes involve patterns of food restriction, and patterns of bingeing, that is, eating followed by purging through vomiting and/or use of laxatives. The binge eating/purging subtype can be distinguished from bulimia nervosa. While both engage in binge eating and purging, the bulimia nervosa maintains body weight that is minimally normal or above normal level (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Some facts about the prevalence (extent) of the disorder are as follows: Anorexia nervosa is more common in females with a 10 to 1 ratio. It is more common in economically advantaged countries like the United States, Australia, and Japan. It is less common in low-and middle-income countries. In the United States, the prevalence is lower among Latinos and African Americans (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The disorder often presents in adolescence or young adulthood. The disorder is found more often in settings that value thinness, such as modeling, acting, cheerleading, and athletics.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they are significantly below normal levels in body weight, have an intense fear of gaining weight, and exhibit practices of food restriction. The diagnosis also depends on displaying undue preoccupation with body weight or denial of


current low body weight. Anorexia nervosa can be either restricting type or binge eating/purging type. Severity of mild, moderate, severe, and extreme forms of this disorder can be specified based on body weight (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The causes and course of this disorder are many and complex. Anorexia nervosa runs in families and it takes a considerable toll on health requiring both medical and dental examinations to determine the level of biological treatment required. In addition, there are often significant neurological ramifications especially to an extended practice of anorexia nervosa. Social aspects of this disease involve consideration of the family dynamics and the role played by the anorexic individual in the family. Within this social context the anorexic develops psychological beliefs about perfectionism or the desire to remain a child. These beliefs are reflected in their everyday behavior, which focuses on excessive food restriction and preoccupation with their body image while largely ignoring other areas of life such as intimacy, work or school, and friendships. While anorexic individuals may initially be able to function adequately in school or work, cognitive performance deteriorates over time as a result of the disorder.


Because of the multifaceted nature of this disorder, its clinical treatment must include medical, dental, and psychological evaluations and interventions. Because this is one of the few mental disorders that can be life threatening, medical evaluation and treatment are required for any individual presenting with an extremely low BMI. Time spent in states of semi-starvation results in loss of bone density, loss of menses , digestion problems, and cardiac arrhythmia . Depression and social relation issues as well as obsessive compulsive behaviors around eating and exercise are also common. Individual and group therapy are common psychological interventions. Because suicide rates among anorexics are very high, assessment of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is essential .




Antabuse is a prescription medication used in the treatment of chronic alcoholism. Its generic name is disulfiram.


Antabuse is used as a conditioning treatment for alcohol dependence. When taken with alcohol, Antabuse causes unwanted and unpleasant effects, and the fear of these effects negatively conditions the individual to avoid subsequent alcohol use. So how does Antabuse work? When alcohol is ingested, the body metabolizes or breaks it down into acetaldehyde, the toxic substance that causes the hangover symptoms experienced after heavy drinking. Normally, the body continues to break down acetaldehyde into acetic acid, a harmless substance. Antabuse interferes with this metabolic process by preventing the breakdown of acetaldehyde into acetic acid. The result is that acetaldehyde levels increase up to 10 times greater than normally occur when drinking alcohol. These very high levels of acetaldehyde cause reactions that range from mild to severe, depending on how much Antabuse and how much alcohol is consumed. In other words, Antabuse serves as physical and psychological deterrent to an individual trying to stop drinking. It does not reduce the individual’s craving for alcohol, nor does it treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms. For these reasons, Antabuse should be used in conjunction with counseling and other treatment methods.


Those with a history of diabetes, severe myocardial disease, coronary occlusion, or psychosis should not take Antabuse. Neither should those with advanced or severe liver disease take Antabuse. Those with a history of seizures, hypothyroidism, or nephritis need close monitoring if Antabuse is used. Besides avoiding alcohol, individuals should also avoid any products containing alcohol, such as cough and cold preparations and


mouthwashes. They should also avoid topical preparations that contain alcohol, such as aftershave lotion and perfume.
   The common mild side effects of Antabuse includes drowsiness and fatigue. Others include nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, throbbing in the head and neck, headache, thirst, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, hyperventilation, and confusion. More severe reactions include respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, heart attack, acute congestive heart failure, unconsciousness, arrhythmias, and convulsions. Antabuse is also associated with impotence.




Antianxiety medications are a class of central nervous system depressants that slow normal brain function. Also known as anxiolytics and sedatives, these drugs are prescribed to reduce anxiety and tension and to induce sleep. Prolonged use or abuse of these drugs can result in substance dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Antianxiety medications are among the most abused drugs in the United States, whether obtained legally by prescription or illegally through the black market.






• Anxiolytic refers to a substance that relieves anxiety and any of a group of medications prescribed to induce a feeling of calm and relaxation and relieve anxiety; it is also called tranquilizers.
• Benzodiazepines is a group of central nervous system depressants that are used to relieve anxiety or to induce sleep.
• Intoxication is a state in which significant behavioral or psychological changes follow ingestion of a substance.
• Sedative is any medication that induces relaxation and sleep.
• Substance abuse is a milder form of addiction than substance dependence wherein the user does experience tolerance or withdrawal symptoms.
• Substance dependence is the state in which an individual requires the ongoing use of a particular substance to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
• Tranquilizer is another name for anxiolytic.
• Withdrawal symptoms are a group of physical and/or psychological symptoms that are experienced when a drug or other substance is discontinued after prolonged use.


Antianxiety medications, or “anxiolytics,” are powerful central nervous system depressants that are prescribed to reduce feelings of tension and anxiety, as well as to induce sleep. Antianxiety medications are usually taken orally, and although these drugs work differently, they all produce a pleasant drowsy or calming effect. When used over a prolonged period, tolerance develops. This means that larger doses are needed to achieve the initial effects. Continued use can lead to physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms result when the dosage is reduced or stopped. When combined with other anxiolytics or other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, the effects are additive.


   The drugs associated with this class of substance-related disorders are benzodiazepines that include Valium, Librium, Xanax, Halcion, and ProSom; barbiturates that include Seconal and Nembutal; and barbiturate-like substances that include Quaalude, Equanil, and Doriden. Each of these antianxiety drugs is capable of producing wakeful relief from tension or inducing sleep, depending on dosage. Other legal uses of antianxiety medications include medical treatment and prevention of seizures, and these antianxiety medications are used as muscle relaxants and anesthetics and to make other anesthetics work more effectively.


Even when these depressants are prescribed for medical reasons, an individual taking central nervous system depressants usually feels sleepy and uncoordinated during the first few days of treatment. As the body adjusts to the effects of the drug, these feelings begin to disappear. If the medication is used long term, the body develops tolerance, and increasing doses are needed to obtain the desired effect of general calming or drowsiness.
   The use of antianxiety medications can pose extreme danger when taken along with other medications that cause central nervous system depression, such as prescription pain medicines, some over-the-counter cold and allergy medications, and alcohol. Use of additional depressants can slow breathing and respiration and can lead to death. Withdrawal from antianxiety medications can be dangerous and should be done under medical supervision. The safest method of withdrawal involves a gradual reduction of dosage. Abrupt withdrawal from these medications can lead to seizures due to the sudden increase in brain activity.


Abuse of antianxiety medication can develop with prolonged use, as tolerance grows relatively quickly. Increasing amounts of the drug are then needed to produce the initial effect. It is not uncommon for individuals to become addicted to antianxiety medications even when they are medically prescribed.





   The most common pattern of abuse and dependence to antianxiety medications involves use among teens and young adults, which escalates to abuse or dependence. Dependence may begin with occasional use at social gatherings and then eventually to daily use and high levels of tolerance. A somewhat less common pattern of abuse and dependence to antianxiety medications involves individuals who initially obtain medications by prescription, usually for treatment of anxiety or insomnia. Though the vast majority of those who use medications as prescribed do not develop substance dependence problems, a significant number develop tolerance and withdrawal symptoms.
   Substance dependence, the more severe form of addiction, involves various cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms associated with continued use of the substance. It always includes both tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Abuse is a less severe form of addiction that may involve risky behavior, such as driving while under the influence. For example, individuals with an abuse disorder may miss work or school or get into arguments with relatives or friends about their substance use. These problems can easily escalate into full-blown dependence. Progression to full-blown dependence begins with intoxication. Intoxication involves significant problematic behaviors or psychological changes, including inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood swings, impaired judgment, and impaired work functioning, that develop during or shortly after use of the antianxiety medication. As with alcohol dependence, these behaviors may be accompanied by slurred speech, unsteady gait, memory or attention problems, poor coordination, and stupor or coma. Memory impairment is not uncommon, especially anterograde amnesia where, like in an alcoholic blackout, the individual does not remember anything that occurs after use of the drug.
Withdrawal is a characteristic syndrome that develops when use of the antianxiety medication is significantly reduced or discontinued abruptly. Abrupt discontinuation of an anxiolytic is similar to the abrupt discontinuation or “going cold turkey” in to heavy alcohol use. Symptoms may include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and body temperature,
sweating, hand tremor, insomnia, anxiety, nausea, and restlessness. Seizures are likely to occur in one out of four individuals undergoing untreated withdrawal. In the most severe forms of withdrawal, hallucinations and delirium can occur. Withdrawal symptoms are generally the opposite of the acute effects experienced by first-time users of the drugs. The length of time of the withdrawal period varies depending on the drug and may last as short as 10 hours or as long as three to four weeks. The longer the substance has been taken and the higher the dosage, the more likely that withdrawal will be severe and prolonged.
   Successful treatment for antianxiety medication addiction typically incorporates several treatment modalities. Psychotherapy or counseling, particularly cognitive behavior therapy, focuses on helping addicted individuals identify and change the behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs that contributed to their drug usage. Combined with prescribed medications to make withdrawal safer and easier, therapy can help the addicted individual in making a full recovery. It may require multiple courses of treatment before full recovery can be achieved. Narcotics Anonymous is an important and necessary part of ongoing recovery support.

Antidepressants are prescribed medications that are primarily used to treat depression and depressive disorders.





• Depressive disorders are medical conditions that interfere with daily life and normal functioning, and involve symptoms such as excessive sadness, altered sleep or eating patterns, and lack of energy. Common depressive disorders are major depression, dysthymic disorder, dysthymia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder with periods of mania and depression.



Antidepressant medications are used primarily to reduce symptoms of depression and in the treatment of anxiety disorders, seasonal affective disorder, some eating disorders, some pain syndromes, migraine headache, smoking cessation, fibromyalgia, and some sleep disorders. The type of antidepressant medication prescribed depends on the particular array of symptoms a patient displays or reports. There are several different types of antidepressant drugs. All of them work by altering the level or activity of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain.
   The main classes of antidepressant medications are tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and atypical antidepressants. Those who do not improve with one type of antidepressant drug may sometimes be helped by another type of antidepressant, because different classes of medication work somewhat differently.
Tricyclic antidepressants. These were the first
class of medications found to be useful in treating depression and related conditions. These medications work by preventing neurons (nerve cells) from reabsorbing the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine after they are released. Tricyclic antidepressants tend to have more side effects than other types of antidepressants. Specific tricyclic antidepressants include Tofranil, Elavil, Anafranil, Sinequan, Norpramin, Pamelor, Vivactil, and Surmontil.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are medications that prevent neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine from being broken down into inactive chemicals. This means that when MAOIs are used, more of these neurotransmitters are available to send messages in the brain. MAOIs can have potentially serious side effects since they prevent the tyramine (an amino acid) from being broken down. Tyramine is found in foods like aged cheese, smoked meats and fish, and raisins. If tyramine cannot be broken down, it can accumulate in the body, causing increased blood pressure and possibly stroke. Specific MAOIs include Marplan, Nardil, and Parnate.
  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of antidepressants that work by preventing neurons from reabsorbing serotonin after it is released. The effect of serotonin on adjoining neurons is prolonged. The SSRIs include Celexa, Lexapro, Prozac, Luvox, Paxil, and Zoloft.
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are a class of antidepressants that work similar to SSRIs. But instead of blocking serotonin only, they block the absorption of both serotonin and norepinephrine. Effexor, Pristiq, and Cymbalta are commonly prescribed SNRIs.
Atypical antidepressants. The atypical antidepressants are a collection of medications with different chemical makeups than the other classes of antidepressants. Examples of atypical antidepressants include Wellbutrin, Remeron, and Desyrel.

Use of antidepressant medications may increase suicidal thoughts in children, adolescents, and adults through the age of 24. Antidepressants can precipitate mania in those who are susceptible to bipolar disorder. Various medical conditions may affect the efficacy or risks of antidepressants. These conditions include headaches, epilepsy, recent heart attacks or stroke, kidney disease, and diabetes. The use of antidepressants in





pregnancy and breast-feeding can be problematic and if used must be done under close medical supervision. Those who abruptly stop taking most antidepressants may experience withdrawal symptoms.
   Antidepressant use often involves side effects. Specific effects depend on the specific medication and the individual’s characteristics. Possible side effects include dry mouth, constipation, nausea, bladder problems, sexual problems, blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia, increased heart rate, headache, nervousness, and agitation. Newer antidepressants, such as the SSRIs and SNRIs, are considered to have fewer and less troublesome side effects than the tricyclic antidepressants and the MAOIs. Antidepressants can interact with other medications, so individuals should inform their doctor about all medications and herbal supplements. Alcohol and recreational drugs can decrease the effectiveness of antidepressants and should not be combined with these medication.


Antipsychotics are prescription medications used to treat psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic depression.


• Extrapyramidal symptoms are side effects of certain antipsychotic drugs. They include repetitive, involuntary muscle movements, such as lip smacking, and the urge to move constantly.


• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially fatal condition resulting from antipsychotic use characterized by severe muscle rigidity (stiffening), fever, sweating, high blood pressure, delirium, and sometimes coma.
• Psychosis is a severe mental condition in which an individual loses touch with reality. Symptoms include hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), delusions (fixed false beliefs that persist despite contrary evidence), and disordered thinking.
• Schizophrenia is a mental disorder in which it is difficult to distinguish real from unreal experiences. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, thought and communication disturbances, and withdrawal from others.
• Schizoaffective disorder is a severe mental disorder in which an individual exhibits signs of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder.
• Tardive dyskinesia are involuntary movements caused by certain antipsychotic medications. They include tongue thrusting, repetitive chewing, jaw swinging, and facial grimacing.

Antipsychotic medications are used to treat psychotic disorders, ranging from schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, substance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic depression. They are also used to treat the psychosis associated with other medical conditions, such as dementia. Antipsychotics are thought to work by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain and interfering with dopamine transmission.
   There are two classes of antipsychotic medications: older or “typical” antipsychotics (also known as first-generation antipsychotics) and newer, atypical antipsychotics (also known as second-generation antipsychotics). The typical antipsychotics have been in use since the 1950s. They are effective in treating





“positive” symptoms of schizophrenia (abnormal thoughts and perceptions, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disordered thinking).
   The “atypical” antipsychotics have been in use since the 1990s. They tend to be effective in treating both positive and “negative symptoms” (lack of speech, “flat” facial expressions, apathy, lack of pleasure in normally pleasurable activities). Clozaril was the first of this class. It proved to be effective in treating disorders that had not responded well to typical antipsychotics. Several other atypical antipsychotics were introduced after Clozaril. These include Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel, and Geodon. There are side effects associated with each of these, but they are generally better tolerated than the conventional types of antipsychotics.

The atypical antipsychotic medications have largely replaced the older medications, presumably because of lower risk of side effects. Choosing which class of antipsychotic medications to use is challenging for the prescriber. On one hand, atypical antipsychotics are more expensive and more likely to cause weight gain and diabetes. On the other hand, they may be more effective than older medications in treating psychotic symptoms.
   The typical antipsychotics were believed to produce a number of unpleasant side effects, the worst of which were extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and tardive dyskinesia. In contrast, the risk of tardive dyskinesia was presumed to be lower with the atypical antipsychotics, particularly Clozaril. However, Clozaril can cause agranulocytosis (a loss of the white blood cells that fight infection). To avoid this, those taking Clozaril must have their white blood cell counts monitored every week or two. The inconvenience and cost of blood tests and the cost of the medication have made treatment with Clozaril difficult for many. This is unfortunate since Clozaril may be the most effective of all the antipsychotic medication. A major research study (the CATIE trial) suggests that the typical antipsychotics may be just as safe and as well tolerated as the atypicals. In the past, these older medications were often used at much higher doses


than are used currently. This may explain why they appeared to cause more side effects.


Antisocial personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of disregarding and violating the rights of others.

• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behavior, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.
• Psychopathic personality is a mental disorder characterized as amoral behavior, inability to love and understand another’s feelings (empathy), extreme self-centeredness, and failure to learn from experience. It is also known as psychopathy and psychopath.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.





• Sociopathic personality is a mental disorder characterized by amoral and criminal behavior and lacks a sense of moral responsibility. It is also known as sociopathy and sociopath.


Antisocial personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by a pattern of antisocial behavior. Such behavior begins in childhood or early adolescence and is characterized by aggressiveness, fighting, hyperactivity, poor peer relationships, irresponsibility, lying, theft, truancy, poor school performance, runaway behavior, and inappropriate sexual activity, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. As adults, assaultive-ness, self-defeating impulsivity, hedonism, promiscuity, unreliability, and continued drug and alcohol abuse may be present. Criminality may be involved. These individuals fail at work, change jobs frequently, tend to receive dishonorable discharges from the military, are abusing parents and neglectful spouses, have difficulty maintaining intimate relationships, and may be convicted and spend time in prison. Antisocial behavior often peaks in late adolescence and early 20s and lessens in late 30s. This disorder is four times more common in males than in females.
In the past this disorder was known as psychopathic personality and sociopathic personality. While there are some similarities among these disorders and antisocial personality disorder, there are differences. The first and second editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders provided descriptions of the psychopathic personality or the sociopathic personality. However, starting with DSM-III, the designation “antisocial personality disorder” has been used along with specific diagnostic criteria.
   The clinical presentation of the antisocial personality disorder can be described in terms of behavioral style, interpersonal style, thinking style, and feeling style. The behavioral style of this disorder is characterized by poor job performance, repeated substance abuse, irresponsible parenting, persistent lying, delinquency, truancy, and violations of others’ rights. These individuals can also be impulsive, angry, hostile, and cunning. Even though they may engage in rule-breaking behavior, they can be successful in business, politics,


and other professions. They are forceful individuals who regularly engage in risk-seeking and thrill-seeking behavior. Their interpersonal style is characterized by antagonism and belligerence. They also tend to be highly competitive and distrustful of others and thus poor losers. Their relationships may at times appear to be “slick” as well as calculating. Their relationships are characteristically shallow and superficial, and often involve no lasting emotional ties or commitments. Their thinking style tends to be impulsive and rigid or inflexible as well as externally oriented. Because they are contemptuous of authority, rules, and social expectations, they easily rationalize their own behavior. Their feeling style of this disorder is characterized by the avoidance of “softer” emotions such as warmth and intimacy because they regard these as signs of weakness. The need to be powerful and the fear of being abused and humiliated lead to a denial of the “softer” emotions as well as their uncooperativeness. Guilt is seldom, if ever, experienced. They also find it difficult to tolerate boredom, depression, or frustration and subsequently are sensation-seekers. In addition, they tend to be callous toward the pain and suffering of others, and show little shame for their own deviant actions.
The cause of the antisocial personality disorder is
not well understood. The parenting style these individuals experienced growing up often was hostile, abusive, or neglectful. Their parents and siblings may have engaged in and modeled antisocial behavior. In addition, these individuals have a characteristic view of themselves, the world, and others, and a basic life strategy. They tend to view themselves as cunning and entitled to take whatever they want. They are also likely to view themselves as strong, competitive, energetic, and tough. They tend to view others as abusive and devious or as easy prey to be used and abused. They tend to view life as hostile and rules as keeping them from fulfilling their needs. Accordingly, their basic life strategy and pattern is to take what they want and break rules and defend themselves against efforts to be controlled or abused by others.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a pervasive pattern of disregarding and violating the rights of others. They disrespect and disregard laws and social





norms, and regularly engage in acts that are grounds for arrest. These individuals lie, are deceitful, and will take advantage of others for pleasure or for personal profit. They are impulsive and fail to plan ahead. They are also irritable and aggressive, which results in physical fights or assaults. It is not surprising that these individuals disregard the safety of others as well as themselves. Their irresponsibility is demonstrated by their failure to engage in consistent work behavior and failure to meet financial obligations. Furthermore, their lack of remorse is shown by their indifference in having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from others (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).


Unlike other personality disorders in which psychotherapy can be effective, the antisocial personality disorder is less amenable to such treatment. Typically, these individuals are usually not interested in making life changes. When treatment is required by the courts, employers, or other agencies, these individuals are likely to resist treatment efforts. However, special residential treatment programs have shown some promise. There appears to be at least one exception to receptivity to psychotherapeutic treatment. When the antisocial personality disordered individual experiences a moderate degree of depression, he or she may be willing to engage in psychotherapy in order to reduce depressive symptoms.






Anxiety disorders in adults are a group of mental disorders characterized by anxiety as a central or core symptom.


• Antianxiety medications are prescribed drugs that relieve anxiety symptoms. They are also called anxiolytics or tranquilizers.
• Anxiety is apprehension or worry about an imagined danger.
• Behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors.
• Cognitive therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing automatic thoughts and maladaptive beliefs.
• Exposure therapy is a behavior therapy intervention (method) in which a client is exposed to a feared object or situation.
• Fear is an emotional response to a known danger.
• Panic is an intense sense of fear.
• Panic attack is an episode of sudden, intense, and debilitating sense of fear that is short lived.
• Phobia is an intense fear of a person, place, or thing that significantly exceeds the actual danger posed.
• Selective mutism is a mental disorder in which children or adolescents fail to speak in some social situations although they have the ability to talk normally at other times.
• Separation anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive anxiety resulting from separation from those to whom a child is attached.






This group of disorders includes specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder that are common in adults. It does not include anxiety disorder that is common in children or adolescents like separation anxiety disorder or selective mutism. Children and/or adolescents can also experience specific phobia. But since they are also common in adults, they are described here. Anxiety disorders in adults share the primary feature of anxiety, anxiety that is not caused by medication or recreational drugs. Adults typically refer to their experience of anxiety as fear, nervousness, worry, tension, or something similar. Many experience anxiety numerous times in their lives, but what separates anxiety disorders from normal experience is that symptoms last for at least six months. In addition, they must cause clinically significant distress or must disrupt the individual’s daily functioning.
Certain  characteristics  have  been  associated
with a risk of developing anxiety disorders in adulthood. First, there may be genetic factors that increase the likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder. Abuse or neglect in childhood may also be a risk factor in the development of anxiety disorders in adulthood.
   Here is a brief description of five anxiety disorders commonly diagnosed in adults.
Specific phobia. Is a phobia related to a specific
fear such as being a passenger on an airplane, blood, closed spaces, or spiders? What separates a specific phobia from a fear is that the experience of fear far exceeds the actual dangers posed, or they may experience anxiety. In addition, they are likely to avoid the feared object(s). Although this condition is primarily concerned with the fear evoked by the phobic object, there is often an element of anxiety leading up to an imminent or likely exposure to it.
   Approximately 8% of the U.S. population has a specific phobia. Furthermore, like most of the anxiety disorders, they tend to occur twice as often in women than men (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Depending on the circumstances,


individuals may be prescribed antianxiety medication for situations in which they will have to endure their phobic object (e.g., for a plane flight). For long-term change, treatment for specific phobia most commonly includes exposure therapy. As the name suggests, individuals are gradually exposed to what they fear while maintaining a relaxed and calm state.
Social anxiety disorder. Also referred to as social
phobia, this disorder is characterized by excessive fear of being critically evaluated by others in a social situation. Often, fear revolves around some sort of performance such as a presentation, dance, or speech. In more severe cases, simply attending a party or having a conversation with a stranger may be sufficient to induce significant fear. Infrequent anxiety or fear related to social circumstances is a common occurrence. What characterizes this disorder from normal social functioning is that the anxiety or fear almost always occurs as opposed to occasionally. Social anxiety can cause someone to become isolated or, in severe cases, unable to maintain relationships and/or be employed.
   Approximately 7% of the U.S. population experiences this disorder. It is notable that this disorder is far less prevalent in some cultures than in the United States. Also, this tends to occur twice as often in women than men (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This disorder is commonly treated with exposure therapy or cognitive therapy.
Panic disorder. Individuals with this disorder experience both recurring panic attacks and anxiety in regard to experiencing future attacks. These attacks may include physical symptoms such as heart palpitations (pounding heart), sweaty palms, shortness of breath, and tingling in the fingers. Individuals experiencing a panic attack may also sense that they are in some way detached from their experience (called derealization). In addition, they may have a sense that they are dying or going crazy.
   An important component of panic attack is that there is no realistic, plausible cause of their acute fear. For example, an individual experiencing a panic attack may think that he or she will choke while having





no physical obstruction of the airway. It is important to note that this condition, like other anxiety disorders, is not caused by medication, drugs, or illness. Panic attack is also different from panic in that normal panic results from a realistic concern. Individuals who experience this disorder may also experience agoraphobia.
   Panic disorder is less prevalent than other anxiety disorders. Approximately 2.5% of the U.S. population experiences panic disorder. Unlike the other anxiety disorders, it seems that panic disorder occurs in similar proportions to both sexes (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This disorder is commonly treated with both drugs and behavior therapy. Antidepressant medications may be prescribed to reduce the anxiety about future attacks, while antianxiety medications may be used to reduce the intensity of the actual attack. Behavior therapy is used to reduce the fear and related anxiety and ultimately resolve the disorder. Treatment often begins with medications that are used only until the fear and anxiety responses are reduced with behavior therapy. Without treatment, this condition will likely become chronic.
  Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a phobia in which individuals experience an intense fear of crowds, public places, open spaces, or places from which they believe that they cannot easily escape. Alternatively, the primary fear may also be embarrassment of being observed panicking by others in the public space. Like other phobias, individuals with this disorder commonly avoid exposure to what they fear. The likelihood of developing this disorder is approximately 1.7% in adolescence and adulthood. Also, it is likely to occur with panic disorder. Agoraphobia is usually treated the same as panic disorder and is treated and simultaneously with it (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Generalized anxiety disorder. Generalized anxiety
disorder is a constant uncontrollable worry that both is excessive and causes individuals distress. The worries may focus on multiple concerns about their children, their health, or their job. Or, the worries may be very broad so that the individual literally worries


about worrying. Those who experience this disorder often have sleeping difficulties and feel fatigued and/ or irritable. Also, they may experience mild physical symptoms such as trembling, muscle tension, or sweating.
   The likelihood that at individual will experience this disorder at some point in his or her lifetime is 9%. It occurs more frequently in those of European descent than non-European descent. Also, it occurs far more frequently in first-world nations than in the developing nations (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Treatment includes a wide range of options, including antidepressants medication, antianxiety medications, cognitive therapies, and behavioral therapies.






Anxiety disorders in youth describe conditions of excessive anxiety and worry that occur in children and manifest in different ways.


• Anxiety is a negative emotional state characterized by feelings of nervousness, worry, and apprehension about an imagined danger.
• Anxiety disorders cause people to feel excessively scared, distressed, and uneasy during situations in which others would not experience these symptoms.


Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses in America. Sometimes these disorders are often difficult to recognize because people attempt to hide them or they get confused for other issues. Anxiety disorders are especially common in children and adolescents. There are several disorders that fall under the category of anxiety disorders. Among the most common anxiety disorders for youth are phobias, panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Phobias are a fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. The fear leads many to completely avoid objects or situations that can cause feelings of terror, dread, and panic. Phobias can substantially restrict a child’s ability to socialize with others, go to school, or participate in family outings. Separation anxiety is a kind of phobia that is common among some children. This anxiety specifically presents when a child is removed from a person or object he or she is attached to. Children and adolescents with phobias or separation anxiety usually anticipate the worst and often complain of fatigue, tension, headaches, and nausea.
   Panic disorder can often result in panic attacks. It is characterized by sudden feelings of terror that strike repeatedly and without warning. Physical symptoms can include chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, feelings


of unreality, and fear of dying. Children and teens with this disorder may experience unrealistic worry, self-consciousness, and tension.
   Obsessive-compulsive disorder describes those who have frequent, unwanted thoughts, behaviors, or feelings. Many times obsessive thoughts or worries lead youth to engage in a pattern of behavior they find difficult to control. Common compulsions may include counting, checking, organizing objects, and excessive hand washing.
   Post-traumatic stress disorder: persistent symptoms of this disorder occur after a child or teen has experienced a trauma. This can include traumatic events such as physical or emotional abuse, natural disasters, or witnessing extreme violence. Usually these children experience nightmares, flashbacks, lack of feeling, sadness, rage, and difficulty focusing.


As with many other psychological disorders, it is still unclear whether the causes of anxiety disorder in young people are more biological or environmental. Some professionals consider anxiety disorders to have both neurological and environmental causes. Researchers indicate that children and adolescents are more likely to have anxiety disorders if their parents or caregivers also have anxiety issues.


In order to properly identify anxiety disorders in youth, it is important to consider physical, cognitive, and emotional characteristics. Anxiety is part of a child’s flight or fight response. Experiencing anxiety helps a child learn how to determine fighting for or fleeing a situation. This is part of normal development and is important to have for balance and mental health. Multiple assessments exist to try to prevent a mistaken diagnosis.
   Mental health professionals must take into account the individual’s general medical condition. Anxiety can often be associated with the experience of certain illnesses or as a side effect of medications. Left untreated, anxiety disorders can debilitate the lives of young people. How well any individual does with treatment depends on the severity of the condition.





Most patients can be helped through a combination of medication and therapy to gain a better quality of life.


Among the range of effective treatments for anxiety disorders are medications, individual therapy, family therapy, or a combination of these. Cognitive behavior therapy in combination with medication is the most effective treatment for youth and adults with anxiety disorders. Therapy can help teach children and adolescents how to deal with their fears by modifying and practicing new behaviors, which can lead to positive change.
   For parents and caregivers it is important to learn about anxiety disorders so that they can understand and help their child with an anxiety disorder. Psychoeducation, support groups, and seeking individual counseling can be helpful for parents who have a child with anxiety disorder. In providing treatment to the youth with anxiety disorders, parents and caregivers should involve the child or adolescent in the process of decision making and problem solving to enhance their success later in life.



Anxiety reduction techniques are skills that an individual can learn, which will help handle or overcome the causes, symptoms, and effects of anxiety, stress, and tension. These techniques are divided into two categories, physical and mental, because of the strong connection between the two for people dealing with anxiety.


• Anxiety is a negative emotional state characterized by feelings of nervousness, worry, and apprehension about an imagined danger.
• Stress is the pattern of specific and nonspecific responses to events that tax or exceed an individual’s ability to cope.
• Stress management is a set of psychological techniques for increasing the capacity to better cope with psychological stress. It usually includes relaxation methods.


Anxiety reduction techniques can be both physical and psychological and help those who suffer from anxiety, tension and stress. Usually the suffering is strong enough that individuals often find it difficult to engage in and enjoy daily living. Sometimes the symptoms are so severe that the person will do just about anything to find relief.
   People who experience anxiety undergo psychological problems that create stress and tension. This mental stress is often related to physical problems as well and leads to chronic anxiety and stress. This long-term anxiety can lower the immune system, increase blood pressure, and increase muscle tension. All of these symptoms can eventually lead to serious life-threatening illnesses. Health-care professionals therefore have sought to treat the causes and symptoms of anxiety, stress, and tension in a variety of ways.





   Medical interventions for anxiety reduction include the use of prescription drugs and have been used for decades. This approach, however, has some problems and can prevent effective long-term resolutions for the problem causing the stress. In addition to that stress, the medication could contribute to addictive behaviors and is a reality when using medication as treatment. Some individuals who use medication to relieve anxiety experience negative side effects and dependency, which leads to more stress and anxiety.
   This vicious cycle led many health-care professionals to explore and begin using other anxiety reduction techniques. Some of these techniques include psychotherapy in the form of relaxation and cognitive behavioral strategies. Research also provides a rationale for the use of physical to reduce anxiety. Both of these techniques can be helpful for professionals working with individuals with anxiety so they can be taught through professional help and continue practicing these techniques outside of therapy.


One of the first modern investigators of the effects of alternative methods on stress was Dr. Herbert Benson, who published the book The Relaxation Response (1975). His approach challenged the medication approach to encourage more psychological and physical activities that reduce stress. Since then the field has rapidly expanded with both traditional medical and alternative approaches multiplying over the years.
   There are a variety of options available for relieving anxiety and stress. Among the most common are physical activities such as diaphragmatic breathing (as in yoga), massage, exercise and relaxation. Common mental relaxation techniques include visualization and imagery, hypnosis, and meditation.
   The clinical basis for the success of these techniques lies in the fact that they stimulate the production of natural opiates in the brain. These brain chemicals have been found to block pain and to create a feeling of euphoria or a “high” much like the medications prescribed for anxiety. Through the natural release of this chemical, individuals with anxiety are less likely


to utilize medication and experience side effects or dependence.

the field of biofeedback to treat anxiety has been introduced. Biofeedback relies on the use of a machine that measures brain waves, cardiac rhythm, pulse, breathing, muscle tension, or conduction of electricity by the skin. It is a conditioning process. When a more internally tranquil state is recorded by the equipment, the patient is rewarded by a pleasant tone or colored light. The procedure then aims at helping the patient concentrate on maintaining the positive changes that have occurred in the body.
   Other more recently popular anxiety reducing techniques include cognitive restructuring. This approach is based on becoming aware of the chronic stressors in life and learning how to reappraise them. This is a kind of cognitive restructuring activity that can lessen the stress of uncertainty and the anxiety about loss of control through identifying and practicing healthy coping mechanisms. In general, the work on optimistic thinking and positive psychology and cognitive restructuring attests to the power of the mind to promote health and well-being.



Anxious personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by a persistent, continuous pattern of anxiety.

• Antianxiety medications are prescribed drugs that relieve anxiety symptoms. They are also called anxiolytics or tranquilizers.
• Anxiety is a negative emotional state characterized by feelings of nervousness, worry, and apprehension about an imagined danger.
• Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by anxiety which tends to be intermittent instead of persistent. The group includes panic disorder, phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder.
• Characterological anxiety is a persistent pattern or trait of anxiety which reflects an individual’s general level of distress. It contrasts with state (situational) anxiety which reflects an individual’s distress in a given situation.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Defense mechanisms are strategies for self-protection against anxiety and other negative emotions that accompany stress.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Exposure therapy is an intervention (method) in which a client is exposed to a feared object or situation. It is also referred to as flooding.
• Generalized anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by chronic anxiety and


multiple exaggerated worries even when there is little or nothing to provoke it.
• Mindfulness practices are intentional activities that foster living in the present moment and awareness that is nonjudgmental and accepting.
• Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behavior, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture. Personality disorder reflects an individual’s unique personality structure.
• Psychoanalytic theory is a psychological theory that explains behaviors and perceptions as the result of unconscious, sexual, and biological instincts. It was originally developed by Sigmund Freud.
• Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM) is a diagnostic system based on psychoanalytic theory that is used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.


Anxious personality disorder is a personality disorder that overlaps considerably with the DSM-5 diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. While anxiety is the psychologically organizing experience in anxious personality disorder, it differs from the anxiety disorders. In most anxiety disorders, the anxieties involve specific objects or situations. For example, with a spider phobia, the anxiety involve spiders, which is a specific object. In contrast, anxious personality disorder involves characterological anxiety, which is a free-floating or global sense of anxiety with no object or situation.
   Those with this disorder have failed to develop adequate coping strategies for dealing with the common stresses and fears of everyday life. They typically report having had a parent, who because of that parent’s own anxiety could not adequately comfort them or provide a sense of security or support.
   Two or more of the following types of anxiety are common among those with this personality disorder:





signal anxiety , moral anxiety , separation anxiety , and annihilation anxiety . This contrasts with the various anxiety disorders in which only one of these tends to predominate.
   Many are surprised to learn that the anxious personality disorder is not included in DSM-5. However, it is described in the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM). According to the PDM (2006), the anxious personality disorder is diagnosable by the following criteria. Individuals exhibit an anxious or timid temperament (inborn personality characteristics). They are preoccupied with being safe amid perceived dangers. Their basic emotion is fear. Their basic belief or view of themselves is that they are in constant danger from unknown forces. Their basic belief or view of others is that others are the sources of either danger or protection. Furthermore, they are unable to adequately shield themselves from such danger because their defense mechanisms are inadequate.

Treatment of the anxious personality disorder tends to be long term and challenging. Therapists do well to demonstrate an attitude of confidence in the individual’s own capacities to tolerate and reduce anxiety. It is also important to develop and maintain a strong therapeutic relationship since these individuals tend to become discouraged because of their long-standing symptoms. Exposure therapy and mindfulness practices can be very useful in anxiety reduction. Other cognitive behavior therapy techniques can be helpful in understanding and mastering this disorder. Antianxiety medications can also be considered in reducing anxiety symptoms. However, because of the risk of addiction, these medications should be prescribed with caution for individuals with this personality disorder.







Apathy is a state of emotional indifference; it is the absence of interest, concern, or enthusiasm in things most people enjoy about life.


“Apathy” is a term used to describe an emotional state of indifference and lack of passion. It is most often a temporary feeling that is experienced by most people. Apathy is frequently a symptom of various psychological and emotional disorders. Apathy is a lack of passion and enthusiasm for life. There is a suppression of emotion or feelings. Apathetic people live with a lack of concern, excitement, or interest in relationships, current events, and meaning in life. They are numb to the excitement and wonder of life.
   Apathy is described as a lack of motivation. It is characterized by a decrease in three key categories of functioning. There is a decrease in goal-oriented behavior in which there is a lack of effort to engage in activities or an overreliance on others to structure activities. There is also a decrease in goal-directed thinking characterized by a lack of interest in learning, a lack of interest in new experiences, and a lack of concern about one’s personal problems. The third category is a decrease in emotion and emotional responsiveness.
   Apathy is most often transient, meaning it is a phase that people go through but do not stay in. Apathy is not depression and is not considered a separate mental health disorder. People suffering from depression are debilitated or incapacitated in some fashion. Depressed people often lack the ability to fully function or engage in life. Apathetic individuals, who are not suffering from a mental health disorder, are able to fully function in life. They just do so with little enthusiasm and passion. A common phrase used by apathetic people is “Who cares?”






Apathy is a common experience in medical and mental health conditions. Apathy is common in depression and in individuals suffering from adjustment disorder and other mood disorders such as persistent depressive disorder. Apathy is also associated with disorders such as Asperger’s syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease. It is also associated with some medical conditions such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Because apathy is not a separate mental health disorder, there is no specific treatment for it. Periods of apathy are considered a normal part of life. When apathy persists over a longer period of time, the individual is more likely to be suffering from a medical or mental health condition.
   Everyone experiences periods of apathy. Apathy is often a coping response after a highly emotional experience takes place. During these times emotional energy is spent and sometimes exhausted; people just run out of emotional energy. Apathy is the experience people have while they recharge or recover emotionally. For instance, consider a senior in high school who has worked very hard to get into a top college. The university has very competitive entrance requirements and the student has studied and worked very hard to get in. She has participated in extracurricular activities and has volunteered in service projects to enhance her chances of getting into this highly regarded university. She has also spent countless hours on the Internet exploring all of the facets of the school and city it is located in. She has followed its football games on television and has a sweatshirt with the school mascot on it. She worked hard on the application, received excellent recommendations from teachers, and submitted the application well before the deadline. But she didn’t get in and is extremely disappointed. We can predict that she will go through a period of time where she doesn’t seem to care about college or where she attends. Because of the intense emotional energy spent in the pursuit of the college, she feels numb and tells her best friend she “couldn’t care less” about college. She declines an invitation to a party and stays home that weekend and mopes around the house. However, after a brief period of time she begins to recover and begins to think about other colleges. She remembers that her best friend talked about her favorite college and she decides to check it out on the Internet.


She is back on track and is excited by the different options she has.
   Apathy is an emotional state that most individuals experience in their lifetime. Short periods of apathy are not cause for alarm and are considered normal. When apathy is longer lasting, it may be a sign of emotional struggle and be of concern if the individual is not functioning well.






• Seizure is an episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that results in physical findings and changes in behavior.
• Stroke is a medical condition when there is deprivation of oxygen to the brain due to a lack of blood flow.


Aphasia is an impairment or disturbance in the comprehension and expression of language. The degree of impairment can range from having difficulty remembering words to having the inability to speak, read, or write. Symptoms can be mild or severe. When the symptoms are severe, communication may be nearly impossible. Some signs and symptoms of aphasia include the inability to form words, inability to repeat a phrase, or inability to pronounce words. Other symptoms may involve the inability to comprehend language, persistent repetition of phrases, inability to name objects, and the inability to write sentences that make sense. Aphasia does not affect intelligence.
   Individuals with cancer, seizures, epilepsy, Al-zheimer’s disease, or other brain diseases may experience aphasia. Those who have had a stroke or head injury are likely to experience severe aphasia. There are also progressive forms of aphasia that develop slowly. These types of aphasia include brain tumor, dementia, or infection. The more extensive the brain damage, the greater the likelihood of severe and lasting disability.
   Aphasia can cause a number of problems in one’s life due to lack of communication. Often, good quality of life is significantly reduced. Aphasia can also cause problems in relationships, jobs, education, and day-to-day functioning. It can also lead to depression, frustration, and humiliation. Some individuals with aphasia are very aware of their difficulties. Others are not so aware of when there is a breakdown in communication. Individuals with aphasia claim the worst part of their disorder is the rejection they receive from others who do not understand what aphasia is.










Asperger’s syndrome, also called Asperger’s disorder, is a diagnosis on the autism spectrum where people have good verbal skills but noticeable social problems.

• Asperger’s disorder is a neurological condition marked by challenges in socializing and restricted interests or repetitive behaviors.
• Autism spectrum disorders are developmental disabilities that affect a person’s ability to communicate, socialize, and behave like most others.


Asperger’s disorder or syndrome is commonly described as a high-functioning form of autism due to normal language development and intelligence. Those who are diagnosed with it exhibit difficulty interacting socially and behave differently than others. They usually have problems such as poor one-on-one conversations, obsessive interest in a limited range of subjects, and repetitive patterns of behavior.
   The disorder is named after Dr. Hans Asperger (1906–1980), an Austrian physician, who first described the particular behaviors that mark people with this syndrome in a paper published in 1944. He observed a group of boys with good language skills but poor communication and motor skills. Dr. Asperger called the group of boys who had marked social problems but good language and cognitive skills the “little professors.” Their limited and all-consuming interests led them to be highly verbal yet seemingly unaware of interest displayed by others. These boys also had awkward motor skills. He also noted that their fathers had experienced similar problems in their lives. A translation of Dr. Asperger’s original paper is provided by Dr. Uta Frith in her book Autism and Asperger Syndrome (1991).
   Although people with AS have good verbal skills, they do have trouble relating socially with the overall effectiveness of their communication. Because of this people with AS are often characterized by what is seen as weird behaviors and experience social isolation in childhood. They have difficulty with two-way and nonverbal communication. When you add in clumsiness with gross motor movement, they often find it difficult to establish common bonds with their peers. These characteristics can have an ongoing and lifelong impact on their ability to live independently and to hold a job or on other important areas of daily life functioning.


Currently, there is not a single cause or group of causes for Asperger’s syndrome nor any of the diagnoses on the autism spectrum. While no specific genes have been found to relate to Asperger’s, some researchers have noted structural differences in specific areas of the brain that do not occur in unaffected children.
   Although we are not sure of the reasons for this, Asperger’s disorder does affect a greater number of males than females, sometimes estimated at four to one ratio. It has often been identified as occurring in families across generations which may indicate that environmental factors also play a role in its development. Those who manifest the characteristics of AS often are of normal to high intelligence. Their limited ability to exhibit age-appropriate social interaction often leads to overcompensation on their limited areas of intellectual interest. This misguided attempt to engage others is often seen as overwhelming them with facts and repetition, which can lead to rejection by their circle of acquaintances. Their inability to read the emotional reactions of others can result in poor judgments about the motives and intents of the people they encounter. The worst result is that they can be victimized and deceived by others.
   People with AS often have impairments with theory of mind. Theory of mind is the mental ability of people to take the perspective of others. This can often lead to social confusion and awkwardness among those with AS and their peers.
   Often teachers and adults responsible for educating and supporting individuals with AS are impressed by their intelligence and verbal skills and can forget or ignore the sometimes less obvious social skill difficulties. People with AS can often be overlooked because their deficits aren’t as obvious as those with more moderate or severe autism spectrum disorders.


Asperger’s disorder is marked by four diagnostic criteria. This includes a limited ability to recognize and use


social interaction skills and lack of success in building relationships with their peers. This is due to limited social turn taking and an overemphasis on their own restricted interests.
   Repetitive patterns of behavior especially around an intense focus on one or a few areas of interest are also present for people with AS. A rigid adherence to routines and need for sameness is characteristic of the diagnosis. In addition, small or whole-body tics like finger flapping or hand twisting are commonly occurring. Many people with AS have ongoing preoccupations with aspects or parts of objects. In order to receive a diagnosis there should be no noticeable delay in language acquisition or learning skills. Yet significant challenges in interpersonal, work, and other areas of social relationships should be present.
   Asperger’s syndrome is considered a chronic or lifelong condition. The prognosis appears significantly better for those with AS than for many others on the autism spectrum. Researchers suggest that as they mature, many people can learn to be self-sufficient and are capable of high-level employment.


While there is no cure for Asperger’s disorder, there are many ways that people can progress. One way to do this involves recognizing and adjusting their behaviors to be more effective communicators in social situations. This can be done through individual and group therapy, behavior modification, and social skills training. People with AS commonly receive behavior, occupational, and language therapy. Education for parents, siblings, and close friends also helps them to limit those with Asperger’s disorder and to recognize and limit any problematic behaviors.




Assertiveness training (AT) is a therapeutic procedure designed to help people improve their sense of self-esteem as well as their ability to communicate more clearly with others.


• Assertiveness is the quality of being self-assured and confident without being aggressive.


In the history of modern American self-help and personal development movements, AT became a popular intervention designed to promote self-respect and self-expression. Assertiveness has been seen not only as a way to express ourselves clearly and act in our own best interests but also as a means of combating social fears and discomfort by standing up for ourselves without undue anxiety. From the beginning assertiveness was identified as a key behavioral skill that could enhance self-esteem and which could be learned and improved through awareness and practice. AT also aims to help people overcome many socially debilitating conditions such as depression, social anxiety, and problems resulting from unexpressed anger. Because of this it came to be part of the teaching and therapeutic practice of many personal development experts, behavior therapists, and cognitive behavioral therapists. Although they exhibit individual differences, the various ATs tend to have some objectives in common. Chief among them is to increase awareness of personal dignity and rights. As such, AT fit nicely into the 1960s and 1970s, a period that saw both the civil rights struggle and the rising demand for equal rights for women. Other commonalities among the trainings include the importance of making the distinction between the three key ideas of passivity, assertiveness, and aggressiveness, whether these are expressed verbally or


nonverbally. Respect for personal boundaries has been another key concept.



   The heyday of AT in its initial forms came in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some self-proclaimed gurus used extreme techniques in an effort to help people break through perceived social barriers. As a result some people acted out in socially inappropriate and obnoxious ways in the name of empowerment and assertiveness. When used poorly and with bad intentions, so-called assertiveness techniques could be psychological tools that led readily to psychological damage or abuse.


Assertive behavior continues to be identified as especially valuable in several areas of psychological health. In health care, which remains a complex and confusing system often controlled by medical experts, it is good to know how to request clearly what you need. It is also important, especially for men, to learn how to be assertive emotionally and clear in their expressions of intimacy. Finally, it can be a great help in being able to know how to say “no” to peer pressures to use drugs or, especially in the case of children and adolescents, to resist unwanted sexual advances.










Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and a compulsive activity level that is more severe than those exhibited by other individuals at a comparable level of psychological development.


• Hyperactivity means more active than is usual or desirable.


Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is one of the most commonly identified, and misidentified, neurobehavioral disorders. The average age of ADHD onset is about seven years of age although it can continue or arise in adolescence and adulthood. Symptoms include problems staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and being over active.
   ADHD affects about 4.1% of American adults aged 18 years and older. It has been estimated that the disorder affects 9.0% of American children aged 13 to 18 years (National Institutes of Health). Men are four times more likely to exhibit signs of ADHD than women. While, as with those on the autism spectrum, studies show that the number of people being diagnosed with ADHD is increasing, it is still unclear how much of this increase is due to the existence of the label to describe dysfunctional behaviors that in the past would only have been seen





as deliberately annoying or impolite behaviors. In order to be classified as ADHD, the questionable behavior patterns that the individual exhibits must clearly interfere with social, academic and/or occupation functioning at the expected developmentally appropriate level.


As with many other conditions, research has not led to a clear conclusion as what causes ADHD, although many studies suggest that genes play a large role. Like many other disorders, ADHD probably results from a combination of factors. In addition to genetics, researchers are considering possible environmental factors as well as how brain injuries, nutrition, and the social environment might contribute to ADHD.
   Recently, the idea that refined sugar causes ADHD or makes symptoms worse is popular, but ongoing research tends to discount this theory, not support it. Inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are the key behaviors of ADHD. While it is normal for people to be inattentive, hyperactive, or impulsive at times, for those who suffer with ADHD, these behaviors are more severe and occur much more frequently. To be diagnosed with the disorder, a person must exhibit symptoms for six or more months and to a degree that is markedly greater than other people of the same age.
   Recognizing ADHD symptoms and seeking help will lead to better outcomes for those affected children, their families, and/or their coworkers. Key symptoms are difficulty sustaining attention and the ability to persist in completing tasks; failure to give sufficient attention to details so that careless mistakes are common; appearing to be distracted or just not hearing instructions; frequent distractions and going from one activity to another without completing any one of them; difficulty organizing work, work space, schedules, or activities; and dislike for activities that demand sustained attention or effort and easy distraction by stimuli irrelevant to the task or activity at hand.
   It is important to remember that other possible causes of these behaviors must be examined and dismissed before it is proper to consider a diagnosis of ADHD.



Most people get distracted, act impulsively, and struggle to concentrate at one time or another. Sometimes, these normal factors may be mistaken for ADHD. Coming to the reasoned conclusion that a person has ADHD is a several-step process. There is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, like anxiety, depression, and certain types of learning disabilities, can exhibit similar symptoms. It is important that the person be medically examined, including hearing and vision tests, to rule out other problems that have similar symptoms to ADHD. It can also be helpful to consult a checklist that rates ADHD symptoms and get a comprehensive picture of the person’s circumstances and developmental history from family and acquaintances.



Currently available treatments focus on reducing the symptoms of ADHD and improving functioning. Treatments include medication, various types of psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments. Treatments can relieve many of the disorder’s symptoms, but there is no cure. With treatment, most people with ADHD can be successful at work and lead productive lives.







Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in youth is when a child or adolescent has problems with controlling overactive behaviors and attending to and focusing on tasks.


• Hyperactivity means more active than is usual or desirable.

While ADHD does affect about 4.1% of American adults aged 18 years and older, the rate is much higher in children. It has been estimated that the disorder affects 9.0% of American children aged 13 to 18 years. Boys are four times more likely to exhibit signs of ADHD than girls (Centers for Disease Control, 2012). ADHD is one of the most commonly identified neurobehavioral disorders that affect young children. The average age of ADHD onset is about seven years although it can continue or arise in adolescence and even into adulthood. Symptoms include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and hyperactivity.
   Researchers and mental health professionals show that the number of children being diagnosed with ADHD is increasing. It is still unclear why this is occurring; in 1970 only 1% of children were diagnosed with ADHD. How much of this increase is due to the existence of the label to describe dysfunctional behaviors that in the past would only have been seen as deliberately annoying or impolite behaviors is unclear.
   In order to be classified as ADHD, the questionable behavior patterns that the individual exhibits must clearly interfere with social, academic, and/or occupational functioning at the expected developmentally appropriate level. In the past few years there has often been a “rush to judgment” that a child may have ADHD where in given situations it may be some level of incompetency in the adult lead (such as a teacher) who is responsible by giving inconsistent, unclear, or contradictory information or instructions.


As with many other conditions, research has not led to a clear conclusion as what causes ADHD, although many studies suggest that genes play a large role. Like many other disorders, ADHD probably results from a combination of factors. In addition to genetics, researchers are considering possible environmental factors as well as how brain injuries, nutrition, and the social environment might contribute to ADHD. Recently, the idea that refined sugar causes ADHD or makes symptoms worse is popular, but ongoing research tends to discount this theory not support it.
   Inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are the key behaviors of ADHD. While it is normal for all children to be inattentive, hyperactive, or impulsive at times, for children with ADHD, these behaviors are more severe and occur much more frequently. To be diagnosed with the disorder, a child must exhibit symptoms for six or more months and to a degree that is markedly greater than other children of the same age.
   Some children with ADHD also have other illnesses or conditions. For example, they may have one or more of the following: a learning disability, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety/ depression, and bipolar disorder. ADHD also may coexist with sleep problems, bed-wetting, substance abuse, or other disorders or illnesses.
   Recognizing ADHD symptoms and seeking help early will lead to better outcomes for both affected children and their families. Some key symptoms include difficulty sustaining attention and the ability to persist in completing tasks; failure to give sufficient attention to details so that careless mistakes are common; appearing to be distracted or just not hearing instructions; frequent distractions and going from one activity to another without completing any one of them; difficulty organizing work, work space, schedules, or activities; dislike for activities that demand sustained attention or effort and easy distraction by stimuli irrelevant to the task or activity at hand. It is important to remember that other possible causes of these behaviors must be examined and dismissed before it is proper to consider a diagnosis of ADHD.





Children are diverse in development and personality; they mature at different rates and have different interests, temperaments, and energy levels. Most children get distracted, act impulsively, and struggle to concentrate at one time or another. Sometimes, these normal factors may be mistaken for ADHD.
   ADHD symptoms can appear early in life, often between the ages of three and six, and because symptoms vary from child to child, the disorder can be hard to diagnose. Parents may first notice that their child loses interest in things sooner than other children or seems constantly “out of control.” Often, teachers notice the symptoms first, when a child has trouble following rules or frequently “spaces out” in the classroom or on the playground.
   Coming to the reasoned conclusion that a child has ADHD is a several-step process. There is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, like anxiety, depression, and certain types of learning disabilities, can exhibit similar symptoms. It is important that the child be medically examined, including hearing and vision tests, to rule out other problems that have similar symptoms to ADHD. It can also be helpful to consult a checklist that rates ADHD symptoms and get a comprehensive picture of the child’s developmental history from parents, teachers, and, sometimes, the child himself or herself. It is also important to remember that certain situations, events, or health conditions may cause temporary maturational delays in behavior in a child that seem like ADHD.

Currently available treatments focus on reducing the symptoms of ADHD and improving functioning. Treatments include medication, various types of psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments. Treatments can relieve many of the disorder’s symptoms, but there is no cure. With treatment, most people with ADHD can be successful in school and lead productive lives.


Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment is a best-selling book about the science of positive psychology and finding real happiness.

• Positive psychology is the science about the best things in life with a focus on positive emotions, traits, and institutions.
• Well-being is the state of being happy, healthy, or successful.


Martin P. Seligman (1942–) is the director of Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He is a leading figure and founder of the Positive Psychology movement. He became world famous when he developed the theory of learned helplessness in the 1960s. His first best-selling book Learned Optimism was published in 1990. It is the first book about positive psychology. After receiving funding and conducting more research on positive psychology, Seligman published Authentic Happiness 2002.
   In a departure from other psychological approaches, Seligman focuses on building positive emotions and strengths in therapy. He states that real, lasting





happiness comes from focusing on one’s personal strengths to improve all aspects of one’s life. Using practical exercises, brief tests, and a website program, Seligman shows readers how to identify their highest virtues and use them in ways they haven’t yet considered. The book is divided into three sections: positive emotions, positive traits, and positive institutions.
   The section on positive emotions is the longest section of the book and focuses on what psychologists know about positive emotions. Seligman uses the terms happiness and well-being as synonyms throughout the book. He discusses the positive results involved in nurturing positive emotions and experiencing life optimally. The scientific research to support the positive effects of positive emotions is highlighted in this section. The second section describes character strengths and the idea of signature strengths, which are a person’s primary positive traits. Seligman lists 24 strengths and virtues that people identify with. Some examples of signature strengths are to be curious, loving, kind, or spiritual. In order for a trait to become a signature strength,
the person must own and enjoy it purposefully.
   The last section of Authentic Happiness discusses the influence of positive institutions or Mansions of Life. It discusses how the ideas of positive psychology apply to many systems in life, including work, family, and education. Seligman focuses on the importance that things in our environment have in influencing our psychological state. Therefore, places like schools and government agencies need to adopt the principles of optimism and positive emotions in order to generate psychologically healthy people.
   As Seligman concludes this book, he recommends ways to achieve happiness or well-being. Achieving happiness is the desired goal in using positive psychology. Happiness and well-being can come by using signature strengths in work, relationships, and finding life’s purpose. Seligman states that happiness is about experiencing life positively and optimistically to achieve this ultimate goal.

The movement of positive psychology, led by Seligman and others, has created a shift in thinking about psychological well-being. The theories and techniques proposed by positive psychologists challenge


the medical model of psychology, which tends to focus on illness and decreasing the negative. The proposition that counseling and therapy should shift from the mindset of reducing bad symptoms to increasing positive traits and emotions was initially seen as radical.
   Positive psychology has not only influenced clients seeking therapy to improve but has also been recommended for counselor well-being. Mental health professionals are vulnerable to burnout and compassion fatigue, which can lead to difficulties in providing effective counseling to clients. Researchers show that students, counselors, and therapists who utilize tools from positive psychology themselves can prevent early burnout and fatigue.
   Since this new wave of psychology was introduced into the field, there has been extensive research and effort put forth. The research and practice of positive psychology has been supported through traditional methods for testing the effectiveness of therapy. The pursuit of authentic happiness and well-being through the use of positive psychology is now supported by mental health professionals around the world. The publication of Authentic Happiness and many other books since has impacted the field greatly with its presentation of a different and easily applicable way of approaching counseling.



Autism is a developmental disability that affects the brain’s ability to help an individual socialize, communicate, and behave like most others.


• Autism spectrum disorders are developmental disabilities that affect the brain and impact a person’s ability to communicate, socialize, and behave like most others.
• Asperger’s syndrome, also called Asperger’s disorder, is a diagnosis on the autism spectrum where people have good verbal skills but noticeable social problems.


Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) include the diagnoses of autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Two other diagnoses that are sometimes considered in the category are Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder, which are rare, regressive genetic conditions.
   In 1943 Leo Kanner, an American psychiatrist, was the first doctor in the world to publish a paper about children with ASDs. Dr. Kanner gave children the label of autism, based on the term created by Dr. Eugen Blueler in 1912 as he described patients who were trying to escape from reality. In Austria, Dr. Hans Asperger also identified children with high-functioning ASDs and worked with Dr. Kanner to write the first medical papers on the subject.
   People with ASDs can be very mildly to severely disabled. In the United States, 1 in 88 children is diagnosed with an ASD. People with ASDs have problems with social, communication, and behavior skills. They can repeat behaviors and might not like change in their routines. These people have different ways of reacting to things, learning, and paying attention.

ASDs have no single cause. Some studies strongly suggest that people are predisposed to having ASDs. In some cases, parents and other family members show mild behaviors that can be linked to autism. Researchers believe that genes and factors in the environment contribute to the disorders.
   There are several signs that help identify that a person might have an ASD. This includes problems with his


or her speech. Individuals with ASD also have the ability and tendency to repeat things. There is likelihood they will avoid eye contact or have atypical facial expressions. People with autism appear to be unaware or uninterested in other people and have trouble understanding other’s feelings. At a young age, children with autism don’t tend to play pretend, such as acting like an animal or feeding a doll. They also don’t typically point to show interest, which is a typical behavior of young children. Many times people with autism react unusually to sensory input, like the way things smell, taste, look, feel, or sound.
   A few main challenges exist for people with ASD. These challenges are in social communication and behaving like their peers. There are ranges of abilities and challenges within these categories. For example, one person with ASD might not be able to talk at all, while another can talk too much without much purpose. Also, one person with ASD might have a few close friends, while another doesn’t know how to socialize at all. Therefore, every person with ASD will act a little bit differently than the other. The most common diagnoses among the ASDs are autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and PDD-NOS.

Autistic disorder is usually diagnosed between the ages of 18 and 36 months. This diagnosis includes speech delay or loss of speech during early childhood. It also includes challenges in self-care like using the toilet and keeping clean. In some cases, people with autistic disorder can have lower intellectual levels than other people. Because of these things, people with autistic disorder are more severely disabled than some other people with ASDs. Children diagnosed at an early age will benefit from therapy or intervention in order to help build their skills. If they learn to speak and behave with progress, they can be less disabled and considered high functioning.
   Asperger’s disorder and PDD-NOS is usually diagnosed between the ages of seven and eight years. People diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder are always able to speak but might not do it well. This means they can communicate but usually not to get their needs met. They also have average or above-average intellect, meaning they are as smart as or smarter than most other people. Because of this, people diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder or PDD-NOS are considered high functioning.






Autism is a lifelong condition that can be helped but not cured. Some people with autism can lead normal or near normal lives. The best studied therapies include behavioral, educational, and medical treatments. These include, but are not limited to, applied behavior analysis, special education, and drug therapy. Counseling and educating families affected by autism can help them cope, get treatment, and find support. Therefore, parent and caregiver treatment and involvement is an essential part of treating the person with autism.




Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are developmental disabilities that affect a person’s ability to communicate, socialize, and behave like most others.


• Behavior is an observable action demonstrated by a human or animal caused by either internal or external occurrences.


Autism spectrum disorders and related conditions impact the neurodevelopment of a person from a young age. Those diagnosed with ASD usually have social and behavioral challenges. These challenges range from mild to severe. In the mildest forms, a person can have trouble making friends and can hyperfocus on areas of interest that are considered odd to others. In severe forms of ASD a person might not be able to speak and might engage in behaviors that result in serious injury. Therefore, people with this diagnosis are different in how they seem to others but overall have problems socializing and acting like their same-aged peers.
   In 1943 Leo Kanner, an American psychiatrist, was the first doctor in the world to publish a paper about children with ASDs. Dr. Kanner gave children the label of autism, based on the term created by Dr. Eugen Blueler in 1912 as he described patients who were trying to “escape from reality.” In Austria, Dr. Hans Asperger also identified children with high-functioning ASDs and worked with Dr. Kanner to write the first medical papers on the subject.

or point to show interest; reacts unusually to the way things smell, taste, look, feel, or sound and has trouble expressing their needs.
   Three main challenges exist for people with ASD. These challenges are in communicating, socializing, and behaving like most others. There are ranges of abilities and challenges within these three categories. For example, one person with ASD might not be able to talk at all, while another can talk too much without making sense. Also, one person with ASD might have many friends, while another doesn’t know how to socialize at all. Therefore, every person with ASD will act a little bit differently than the other. The most common diagnoses among the ASDs are autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).

Currently ASD identifies people of different abilities on a range of mild, moderate, or severe. In past years, ASDs have included the diagnoses of autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and PDD-NOS. Two other diagnoses that are sometimes considered in the category are Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder, which are rare, regressive genetic conditions. These labels are no longer used medically but could still be used in common language.
   Severe forms of ASD, like the former autistic disorder, are usually diagnosed between the ages of 18 and 36 months. This diagnosis includes a speech delay or loss of speech during early childhood. It also includes challenges in taking care of oneself, like using the toilet and keeping clean. In some cases, people with autistic disorder can


might not do it well. This means they can communicate but usually not to get their needs met.

Avoidant Personality Disorder

Avoidant personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a pattern of social withdrawal, feelings of inadequacy, and oversensitivity to negative evaluation.


• Assertiveness training is a behavior change method for increasing self-esteem and self-expression in intimidating interpersonal situations.
• Desensitization techniques are behavior change methods for reducing an individual’s oversensitivity to fearful situations by intentionally and gradually exposing the individual to various emotionally distressing events.
• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behavior, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.


The avoidant personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of social isolation, fearfulness, nonassertiveness, feelings of inadequacy, social awkwardness, and extreme sensitivity to criticism and rejection. Because individuals


with this disorder believe they are socially inept, unappealing, or inferior, they fear being embarrassed, criticized, or rejected. So, when faced with the prospect of making new social contacts, they predictably say a quick “no” to new work or social relationships that may threaten their otherwise safe and controlled life space. The only exception is when they are certain of being liked and accepted by another. Both the avoidant personality disorder and the schizoid personality disorder are socially isolative. However, unlike those with schizoid personality disorder, avoidant individuals actually crave relationships and often have some friends with whom they feel safe. Those with avoidant personalities share some features with the dependent personality disorder. These include feelings of inadequacy and a lack of assertiveness.
   The avoidant personality disorder is characterized by the following behavioral style, interpersonal style, thinking style, and feeling style. The behavioral style of avoidant personalities is characterized by social withdrawal, shyness, distrustfulness, and aloofness. Their behavior and speech is both controlled and inactive, and they appear nervous and awkward. Interpersonally, they are overly sensitive to rejection. Even though they desire acceptance by others, they keep distance from others and require unconditional approval before being willing to “open up.” They often “test” others to determine who can be trusted to like them. Their thinking style is one of heightened alertness and self-doubt as they scan their emotional environment searching for clues of potential criticalness or rejection. Their feeling style is marked by shyness and nervousness. Since they have often experienced criticism, disapproval, and nonacceptance by others, they often experience feelings of sadness, tenseness, and loneliness.
The cause of this disorder is not well understood.
Avoidant personality disorder is strongly associated with anxiety disorders and is associated with actual or perceived rejection by parents or peers during childhood. Furthermore, these individuals tend to have characteristic view of themselves, the world, and others, and a basic life strategy. They view themselves as adequate and frightened of rejection. They tend to view the world as unfair, demanding, critical, and





rejecting. Accordingly, their basic life strategy and pattern is to be vigilant, demand reassurance, and fantasize and daydream about being involved in safe and affirming relationships. So, it is not surprising that those with avoidant personalities are attracted to virtual relationships in romance novels and soap operas. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a pervasive pattern of being socially inhibited, feeling inadequate, and overly sensitive to the negative evaluations of others. This is typically because they view themselves as socially inept, unappealing, or inferior to others. They consistently avoid work activities that require close interpersonal contact for fear of being criticized or rejected. They will not get involved with others unless they are certain of being accepted. Fearing they will be shamed or ridiculed, they are uncomfortable and act with restraint in intimate relationships. In anticipation of shame or ridicule, they are uncomfortable and are hesitant in intimate relationships. Similarly, they experience feelings of inadequacy and inhibition in new interpersonal situations. Commonly, these individuals will refuse to take personal risks or engage in activities that may prove embarrassing.

The clinical treatment of this disorder usually involves psychotherapy. A primary goal of therapy is to desensitize the individual to the criticism of others. Desensitization techniques are useful and effective in this regard. A related goal is to increase the individual’s self-esteem, self-confidence, and assertiveness. Assertiveness training can also be effective in reversing an individual’s avoidant and isolative pattern.


Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is a mental disorder characterized by avoiding or restricting food intake.

• Anorexia nervosa is n mental disorder characterized by refusal to maintain minimal normal body weight along with a fear of weight gain and a distorted body image.
• Behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors.
• Bulimia nervosa is a mental disorder characterized by recurrent binge eating with loss of control over one’s eating and compensation for eating.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Feeding and eating disorders are a class of DSM-5 mental disorders characterized by a persistent disturbance of eating that significantly





impairs physical health or everyday functioning. They include anorexia nervosa and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapy and therapeutic counseling.
• Specifiers are extensions to a diagnosis that further clarifies the course, severity, or type of features of a disorder or illness.
• Systemic desensitization is a behavioral technique in which an individual is gradually exposed to an object, place, or event that triggers anxiety, while engaging in some type of relaxation at the same time to reduce the symptoms of anxiety.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is one of the DSM-5 feeding and eating disorders. It is characterized by avoiding or restricting food intake. Common symptoms include not being able to eat certain foods based on their texture or aroma. Some individuals with this disorder may only like hot or cold foods or hard or soft foods. Others will refuse foods based solely on color. For example, an individual may not eat strawberries because he or she does not like the color red. In some cases, individuals will refuse entire food groups like vegetables and fruits. Individuals with this disorder may even limit certain food types based on specific brands (e.g., store brand name of a cereal versus Kellogg’s brand cereal). Other symptoms include unfavorable reactions to foods, such as vomiting or gagging. Infants with this disorder may show signs of irritability and difficulty consoling during feeding times, and may appear uninterested or withdrawn.
The name of this disorder was replaced in the
DSM-5. It was previously known as “Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood” in the previous edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). DSM-5 has expanded the disorder to include adults as well as infants and children.


   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if an individual is avoiding or restricting the intake of food and fail to meet the necessary requirements for nutrition or sufficient energy. One of the following criteria is also needed for the diagnosis. The criteria are significant loss of weight, significant deficiency in nutrition, dependence on oral supplements, use of a feeding tube, or noticeable interference with psychosocial functioning. The disturbance does not occur solely in anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. The diagnosis cannot be made if symptoms are the result of a medical condition or another mental disorder. The diagnosis must include the specifier, in remission if none of the criteria have not been met for an extended period (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The occurrence of this disorder most commonly occurs in early infancy or early adolescence but may persist into adulthood. Furthermore, avoiding or restricting foods may be based on sensory characteristics of foods introduced in the first decade of life but may occur as well into adulthood. In some cases, parent–child interaction may contribute to the infant’s and adolescents’ feeding problems (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). For example, presenting food to the child inappropriately or a parent interpreting a child’s behavior as an act of regression or rejection may contribute to this disorder. Inadequate nutritional intake may worsen irritability and developmental delays for infants, adolescents, and adults. If child abuse or neglect is suspected as a cause of this disorder, changing caregivers has been shown to improve this disorder. No matter the age of an individual with this disorder, social functioning tends to be negatively affected.

Psychotherapy is often effective in the treatment of individuals with this disorder. Cognitive behavior therapy is particularly effective for adults with this disorder. Behavioral therapy, particularly systemic desensitization, is an effective form of treatment for children with this disorder. It can help a child and parent





overcome feeding problems and the dislike and avoidance of certain foods. By changing the texture of foods and the pace and timings of the feedings, individual can and do improve.


The Oxford English Dictionary cites the first recorded use of the phrase “baby boomer” in 1970 in an article in The Washington Post. The term has since been used commonly to describe this counterculture. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, “baby boom” refers to a 19-year period following World War II that was marked by a noticeable increase in the birth rate. This cultural phenomenon was documented in North America and Europe. In Canada, this group is referred to as “Boomies,” and in Great Britain the time period is termed “the bulge.” Historians and authors differ regarding time limits for the era as well as the reasoning for this population spike. Some historians attribute the boom to a desire for normalcy and sense of hopefulness about the future following 16 years of depression and war. Attainment of “the American Dream” felt possible. Others argue that the Cold War campaign urged Americans to outnumber communists. The baby boomer generation is made up of two broadly defined cohorts, the leading-edge boomers and the trailing-edge or late boomers. The leading-edge boomers, encompassing more than half of the generation,


are individuals born between 1946 and 1955. The trailing-edge or late boomers are individuals who were born between 1956 and 1964. Subsegments of the generation have also been identified and include the following monikers: golden boomers, genera-tion Jones, alpha boomers, yuppies, zoomers, and cuspers.
   Approximately 76 million babies were born in the United States alone during the baby boom, comprising 40% of the total population. Such a rapid increase in population requires nations to prepare for the shift. As a result of the baby boom, many industries and corporations grew more profitable, in particular those associated with housing, retail, and technology. Suburban communities also exploded.
   Boomers came of age during the 1960s and 1970s, periods of dramatic social change. Conservative and liberal views clashed. Political controversies were at the forefront: opposition to the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and the feminist cause. Thus, baby boomers changed the political landscape of the United States to some extent. This generation has been since associated with qualities such as independent thinking, ingenuity, and resistance to tradition.

The baby boomers were the most successful, active, and well-educated generation up to that time and among the first to grow up genuinely expecting the world to improve with time. Nearly 90% of boomers completed high school, and almost 30% went onto pursue a college degree or higher. By comparison, Generation X, those born between 1965 and 1980, has been nowhere near as populous or prosperous as their parents. 

Albert Bandura is a Canadian American psychologist who is best known for his development of social learning theory and the concept of self-efficacy. He is also known for the controversial 1961 Bobo doll experiment. He is ranked as the fourth most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.


Albert Bandura was born in Mundare, Alberta, Canada, on December 4, 1925. He is of Ukrainian and


Polish descent. He was the youngest of six children and the only male child. Mundare, Canada, was a remote town of fewer than 500 inhabitants with limited educational resources, and Bandura attended the one and only school. Due to a shortage of teachers and resources, learning was left to the student’s own initiative and motivation. This early educational experience was to play a role in the development of Bandura’s social learning theory.
   After graduating from high school Bandura worked in the Yukon, repairing the Alaska Highway. Bandura found himself working alongside of criminals, draft dodgers, alcoholics, and other socially challenged individuals. Bandura credits this experience with his interest in psychopathology. Bandura enrolled at the University of British Columbia intending to study the biological sciences. After taking a psychology course just to fill a vacant time slot, he decided to pursue the subject for degree. He graduated in three years (1949) and received his first award: the Bolocan Award in psychology, given only to the top student in psychology. Bandura then attended the University of Iowa and in 1952 graduated with his PhD. Also in 1952 Bandura married Virginia Varns. The couple would have two children and were married for 59 years until Virginia’s passing in 2011.

After earning his doctorate degree Bandura was offered a position at Stanford University, where he continues to work to this day. Bandura began to investigate how family patterns lead to aggressive behavior in children. He discovered that children who behaved very aggressively had parents who had hostile and aggressive attitudes. Bandura concluded that children learned to be aggressive by observation and imitation. He called this process “social learning.”
   Bandura’s early study into human behavior led to an experiment referred to as the Bobo doll experiment. Using an inflatable doll one group of children was shown a film of a woman beating and yelling at the Bobo doll. Another group of children was not shown the film and another group shown a film of nonaggressive behavior toward the doll. After the film was watched, the children were allowed to play in a room that had a Bobo doll in it. The children who viewed the







film of aggressive behavior where much more likely to beat and yell at the doll, imitating the behavior they saw in the film. The other groups did not behave aggressively. The children who beat the Bobo doll did not receive any encouragement or incentives to do so. They did it on their own, simply by observing and then imitating the behavior they saw on the film. At the time most psychologists thought that all behavior had to be reinforced, or rewarded, before it was learned. Bandura’s Bobo doll experiment demonstrated that behavior can be learned without being rewarded. This was a very new way of thinking about how people learn, develop, and behave as human beings. Although some people criticized the experiment for training children to act aggressively, the Bobo doll experiments are considered one of the great psychological experiments of the

20th century. In 1977 Bandura’s book Social Learning Theory was published and had a significant impact on the direction of psychology during the 1980s.
   Another significant contribution Bandura has made to the field of psychology is the development of the concept of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy refers to a person’s attitude about himself or herself and belief in his or her own abilities to complete tasks and reach goals. Bandura demonstrated that people with high self-efficacy are able to accomplish their goals, are not overcome by obstacles, and are able to positively solve problems. People with low self-efficacy give up easily, feel helpless, and are unable to change situations to reach their goals.
   Albert Bandura is one of the most influential and distinguished psychologists of the 20th and 21st





centuries. He has served on advisory boards, federal agencies, research panels, congressional committees, and commissions of the American Psychological Association. He has received more than 15 honorary university degrees recognizing his contributions to the field of psychology. He has received numerous awards for distinguished scientific contributions to the field of psychology and education. He is also the recipient of the Outstanding Lifetime Contribution to Psychology Award from the American Psychological Association.

Barbiturates are a class of prescribed drugs that slow the nervous system and are prescribed primarily for sedation, general anesthesia, and treating some types of epilepsy.


• Epilepsy is a medical condition involving episodes of irregular electrical discharge within the brain that causes impairment or loss of consciousness, followed by convulsions.
• Benzodiazepines is a group of central nervous system depressants that are used to relieve anxiety or to induce sleep.
• Seizure is a sudden convulsion or uncontrolled discharge of nerve cells that may spread to other cells throughout the brain.


• General anesthesia is a drug-induced loss of consciousness and physical sensation.
• Recreational drugs refer to the use of a drug with the intention of creating a psychoactive or heightened psychological experience; typically, such use is illegal. These drugs are also called street drugs.

The signature feature of barbiturates is their capacity to effectively depress the central nervous system and produce sedation. In the 1960s and 1970s barbiturates were commonly prescribed to treat anxiety and insomnia. However, because of their abuse potential, the prescription use of barbiturates has declined and the drug has been largely replaced by benzodiazepines. Today, barbiturates are used to sedate patients prior to surgery as well as to produce general anesthesia. They are also used to treat some forms of epilepsy. Barbiturates still in use include Fiorinal (generic name: butalbital) and Seconal (generic name: secobarbital) to treat insomnia and Nembutal (generic name: phenobarbital) to treat seizures.
   These drugs are highly addictive and are often abused as recreational drugs. Although still commercially available, barbiturates are no longer routinely recommended for insomnia because of their ability to cause dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal. In general, barbiturates lose their efficacy when they are used to treat insomnia on a daily basis for more than two weeks. These drugs also have significant side effects when taken in large doses and can cause respiratory failure and death.


Barbiturate abuse can occur when these drugs are taken for a prolonged period of time or in higher than prescribed doses. Long-term barbiturate use should be avoided unless there is a strong medical need, such as uncontrolled seizures. Women should not use barbiturates during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary. Those addicted to barbiturates while pregnant can give birth to addicted babies who may suffer withdrawal symptoms after birth. Women who are breast-feeding





should not take barbiturates because these drugs enter the breast milk and may cause serious side effects in the nursing baby. Children who are hyperactive should not receive phenobarbital or other barbiturates. Some children, paradoxically, become stimulated and hyperactive after receiving barbiturates. Elderly patients must be carefully monitored for confusion, agitation, delirium, and excitement if they take barbiturates. Barbiturates should be avoided in elderly patients who are receiving drugs for other mental disorders such as schizophrenia or depression. While taking barbiturates individuals should not drive, operate heavy equipment, or perform other activities requiring mental alertness.
   The most common side effect of barbiturate use is drowsiness. Less common side effects include agitation, anxiety, breathing difficulties, clinical depression, constipation, confusion, dizziness, low blood pressure, nausea, decreased heart rate, nightmares, and vomiting. Rare side effects include fever, headache, anemia, allergic reactions, and liver damage. Overdosing on barbiturates or combining barbiturates with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants can cause unconsciousness and even death. Emergency medical treatment is needed for anyone who shows signs of an overdose or a reaction to combining barbiturates with alcohol or other drugs. Such signs include severe drowsiness, breathing problems, slurred speech, staggering, slow heartbeat, excessive confusion, and severe weakness.

 Paul, Minnesota, Melody Beattie rose to become a widely acclaimed self-help author,


particularly among the addiction and recovery circles following the release of her international best seller, Codependent No More. The book was published in 1986 and has since sold more than 8 million copies and has been translated into several languages.


Codependence is an unhealthy level of emotional or psychological dependence on a loved one whereby one or both individuals in the relationship need the other to feel fulfilled.
   Beattie’s firsthand knowledge of the difficulty of struggling with addictions began at an early age. After being abandoned by her father, kidnapped at age four, and later sexually abused by a neighbor, she began drinking while still in middle school. She became an alcoholic by the age of 13 and a drug addict by age
18. She started hanging out with a crowd that robbed pharmacies for drugs, and her criminal activity ultimately led her to enter a court-mandated treatment center.
   Beattie is considered a beloved self-help author of more than two dozen books and is a household name in addiction and recovery circles. Through her international best seller and writing numerous other books, she has helped millions of followers by sharing her firsthand knowledge of addiction struggles. In addition to surviving abandonment, kidnapping, sexual abuse, and addiction, she has persevered through divorce and the death of a child. For many, her real-life experience gives her credibility and standing to tackle these difficult issues.
   Beattie was motivated by her personal struggles of loving someone who suffers from addiction. She has been quoted as saying that there were many books out there about how to help an addict or an alcoholic, but no one was discussing how the addict impacts the lives of the people around him or her.
   The concept that she writes about, codependency, is considered an integral part of the relationships among those with addiction or substance abuse issues. Beattie explains that codependent individuals frequently become obsessed with controlling the addict’s behavior in an often futile attempt to keep that person from creating chaos and trouble.







   The term codependence emerged during the early 1980s and was often used to describe the spouse of an addicted individual. For example, a wife with an alcoholic husband focused her time and resources to making excuses to family and friends, buying alcohol, and keeping the peace within the family. Eventually, all of her activities began to revolve around her husband’s drinking. A few of these codependent women founded Al-Anon in 1990, which offers support groups modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous as a way of supporting the needs of family members of alcoholics.

American psychiatrist, Aaron T. Beck, is credited as the father of cognitive therapy and is known for his extensive research into psychiatric illnesses and for developing various self-report measures to assess anxiety and depression.


Aaron Temkin Beck, was born July 18, 1921, in Providence, Rhode Island, the third son to Russian Jewish immigrants, Elizabeth Temkin and Harry Beck. Two of Beck’s siblings died before he was born. His early years were comfortable, growing up in a typical middle-class family and participating in Boy Scouts and athletics. However, at the age of eight he developed a serious staph infection, causing him to be hospitalized and drastically limiting his involvement in sports; he resorted to solitary activities like reading. This experience also resulted in Beck’s overwhelming fear of blood, doctors, and hospitals, phobias he would later overcome by training himself to think rationally. Beck proved to be an exemplary student. He attended Brown University majoring in English and Political Science, was a member of the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa Society, served as an editor on The Brown Daily Herald, and received several accolades, including the Philo Sherman Bennett Essay Award Francis Wayland Scholarship, the William Gaston Prize for Excellence in Oratory, and the Francis Wayland





while conducting multiple studies on patients suffering from chronic depreson. This approach, which he termed “cognitive therapy” (CT), is a type of talk therapy that employs problem-solving techniques by challenging clients’ negative “automatic thoughts” in order to alter faulty thinking, instill hope, and restore a positive outlook on recovery. Cognitive therapy has proven effective in treating a variety of psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, substance abuse problems, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and suicidal ideation. CT is noted for its solid research support, and is also a cost-effective, time-conscious, and longer-lasting treatment.

Dr. Beck and his daughter, Dr. Judith Beck, founded the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Research in Philadelphia in 1994, where he still serves as President Emeritus and his daughter as president. The institute continues to conduct research and provide training and therapy to professionals, educators, and clients from all over the world. He is also director of the Aaron T. Beck Psychopathology Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Beck has taught at Oxford, Temple, and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, in addition to his long-standing presence at Penn where he presently serves as Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry. He has received honorary degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, Brown University, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, and Assumption College. A variety of self-report measures to gauge anxiety and depression were developed by Dr. Beck, including the widely used Beck Depression Inventory, as well as the Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. Beck has authored or coauthored over 600 professional journal articles and 25 books, some of which include Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders, Depression: Causes and Treatment, Cognitive Therapy of Anxiety Disorders: Science and Practice, and Anxiety Disorders and Phobias: A Cognitive Perspective. Dr. Beck’s accomplishments are substantial, and he has been the recipient of many awards such as the Heinz Award in the Human Condition, Kennedy


Community Mental Health Award, the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award, the Anna-Monika Prize, the Adolf Meyer Award, and the Morselli Medal for Lifetime of Research in the Field of Suicide. Cognitive therapy is the most widely used and rigorously studied psychotherapy approach to date. It has profoundly impacted the psychological health of millions of people worldwide so much so that The American Psychologist deemed Dr. Aaron T. Beck as “one of the five most influential psychotherapists of all time.”

Beck Depression Inventory

The Beck Depression Inventory is a widely used clinical measure (questionnaire) of depression.


• Cognitive therapy is a psychological treatment that focuses on changing cognitive beliefs and thinking patterns to produce behavioral change.
• Depression is a mental condition characterized by sadness and loss of interest in life, sleep problems, loss of appetite, loss of concentration, and even thoughts of self-harm.
• Dysthymic disorder is a less severe but chronic (ongoing) form of depression.

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21 multiple-choice questionnaire developed to measure the intensity, severity, and depth of depressive symptoms in individuals between the ages of 13 and 80 years. The BDI serves at least two purposes: first, to detect or screen for depression in mental health and primary care settings; and second, to assess and monitor for changes in depressive symptoms. The BDI usually takes between 5 and 10 minutes to complete as part of a psychological or medical examination. The paper and pencil or computer version is either filled out by an individual (self-report) or administered verbally by a trained professional. The BDI also helps measure symptoms related to depression such as fatigue, irritability, guilt, weight loss, and apathy. A shorter form is also available; it is composed of seven questions or items and is used primarily to screen for depression in primary care settings.
Developments and Current Status
The BDI was developed and published in 1961 by Aaron T. Beck, MD (1921–), the founder of cognitive therapy. It was adapted in the 1970s and copyrighted in 1978 (BDI-1A). A more recent version (BDI-II) was developed and published in 1996 by Beck, Robert
A. Steer, and Gregory K. Brown. The BDI is divided into two subscales. The affective subscale consists of eight items that measure psychological, or mood, symptoms. These items include negative thoughts involving. pessimism, past failures, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal thoughts, and worthlessness. The other subscale focuses on somatic or physical symptoms. It


21 or over represents depression. For those who were clinically diagnosed with depression, BDI-II scores from 0 to 13 represent minimal depressive symptoms, scores of 14 to 19 indicate mild depression, scores of 20 to 28 indicate moderate depression, and scores of 29 to 63 indicate severe depression. The BDI can distinguish between different subtypes of depressive disorders, such as major (severe) depression and dysthymic disorder.
   The BDI has been shown to be valid and reliable, with results corresponding to clinician ratings of depression in more than 90% of all cases. Finally, it should be noted that the BDI is one of the most widely used assessment tests by medical and mental health professionals and researchers for measuring depressive symptoms.

Behavior Therapy

has 13 items, such as loss of energy, agitation, and

indecisiveness.
   The long form of the BDI is composed of 21 questions, each with four possible responses. Each response is assigned a score ranging from zero to three, indicating the severity of the symptom that the patient has experienced over the past two weeks. The sum of all BDI item scores indicates the severity of depression. The test is scored differently for the general population and for those who have been clinically diagnosed with depression. For the general population, a score of

Behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors. It is also referred to as behavioral therapy.


• Behavior modification is the use of learning principles to increase the frequency of desired behaviors and decrease the frequency of problem behaviors.





• Behavioral analysis is a type of assessment that focuses on the observable and quantifiable aspects of behavior and excludes subjective phenomena such as emotions and motives.
• Dialectical behavior therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on learning skills to cope with stress, regulate emotions, and improve relationships.
• Mindfulness refers to paying attention in a particular way that is intentional, in the present moment, and nonjudgmental.
• Reinforcement is a behavioral modification process in which certain consequences (effects) of behavior increase the probability that the behavior will occur again.
• Shaping is a behavioral modification process for reinforcing responses that come sufficiently closer to the desired response.


Behavior therapy (BT) is a treatment approach based on the assumption that behavioral (including emotional) problems are learned responses to the environment and can be unlearned. Traditional BT focuses only on observable behavior and so ignores mental processes. Thus, instead of uncovering and understanding the unconscious processes that underlie maladaptive behavior, behavioral therapists assist clients in directly modifying the maladaptive behavior or developing a new, adaptive behavior. Basic to BT is the antecedent-behavior-consequence model of behavioral analysis, which describes the temporal sequence of a problematic behavior in terms of its “antecedents” (stimulus situation that cues or triggers behavior), behaviors (the problematic behavior itself), and consequences (the effects or outcomes that follow the behavior). Three types of behavior problems can be identified from this analysis: behavior excesses, deficits, or inappropriateness. Core concepts of BT include respondent and operant conditioning and positive and negative reinforcement.
Various strategies are utilized in traditional BT
to promote the desired (new or modified) behavior.


These include shaping the consequences (effects or outcomes) of a behavior so that a desired behavior is reinforced and the undesired ones are extinguished. The desired behavior is then rehearsed (practiced). In addition, therapeutic interventions such as skill training, exposure, response prevention, emotional processing, flooding, systematic desensitization, and homework are used to achieve specific therapeutic outcomes.


BT has evolved over the years. A useful way of understanding this evolution is in terms of its three waves. The first wave emphasized traditional BT, which focused on replacing problematic behaviors with constructive ones through classical conditioning and reinforcement techniques. Joseph Wolpe (1915–1997) pioneered classical conditioning, particularly systematic desensitization. Traditional BT was a technical, problem-focused, present-centered approach that contrasted with other therapy approaches. The second wave involved the incorporation of the cognitive therapies. These cognitively oriented approaches focused on changing problematic feelings and behaviors by changing the thoughts that cause and perpetuate them. CBT, which was an integration of both behavioral and cognitive techniques, emerged during this phase. The third wave involved the reformulation of conventional CBT approaches. Third-wave approaches were and are more experiential and indirect and utilizes techniques such as mindfulness, dialectics, acceptance, values, and spirituality. Unlike the first and second waves, third-wave approaches emphasize second-order change, that is, basic change in structure and/or function, and are based on contextual assumptions, including the primacy of the therapeutic relationship. Next is a description of CBT followed by descriptions of three common third-wave approaches.


Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapy approach that addresses maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts with various goal-oriented,





explicit systematic interventions. The name refers to behavior therapy, to cognitive therapy, and to therapy based on a combination of basic behavioral and cognitive principles and research. Many therapists working with individuals dealing with anxiety and depression use a combination of cognitive and behavioral therapy. CBT acknowledges that there may be behaviors that cannot be controlled through rational thought. CBT is “problem focused” (undertaken for specific problems) and “action oriented” (therapist tries to assist the client in selecting specific strategies to help address those problems). CBT is thought to be effective for the treatment of a variety of conditions, including mood, anxiety, personality, eating, substance abuse, tic, and psychotic disorders. Many CBT treatment programs for specific disorders have been developed, evaluated for efficacy, and designated as evidence-based treatment. CBT is the most commonly practiced therapy approach in North America.
CBT was developed through an integration of cognitive therapies with behavior modification in the late 1970s. The term cognitive-behavior modification was first used by psychologist Donald Meichenbaum (1940–). The cognitive therapies include cognitive therapy, which was developed by Aaron Beck, and rational emotive behavior therapy, which was developed by Albert Ellis. While rooted in rather different theories, these two traditions have been characterized by a constant reference to experimental research to test hypotheses, at both clinical and basic levels. Common features of CBT include its focus on the present, the directive role of the therapist, structuring of the psychotherapy sessions, and on alleviating symptoms.


Dialectic behavior therapy (DBT) was developed for the treatment of borderline personality disorder by American psychologist, Marsha Linehan (1943–). More recently, it has been modified and extended for use with other personality disorders as well as Axis I or symptom disorders such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and substance disorders. DBT is an outgrowth of BT but is less cognitive than traditional CBT since DBT assumes that cognitions are less important than emotional regulation. Four primary


modes of treatment are noted in DBT: individual therapy; skills training in a group, telephone contact, and therapist consultation.


Cognitive behavior analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) is a form of CBT that was developed by the American psychologist James P. McCullough (1942–). Basic to this approach is a situational analysis that combines behavioral, cognitive, and interpersonal methods to help clients focus on the consequences of their behavior and to use problem solving for resolving both personal and interpersonal difficulties.
   The goal of CBASP is to identify the discrepancy between what clients want to happen (the desired outcome) in a particular situation and what has happened or is actually happening (the actual outcome). Treatment consists of two phases: elicitation and remediation. Elicitation involves a detailed analysis of a specific situation. In remediation, behaviors and thoughts are therapeutically processed so that new behaviors and thoughts will result in their desired outcome.


Based on the mindfulness teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh (1926–), psychologist Jon Kabat-Zinn (1944–) developed what he called mindfulness-based stress reduction in 1979. This method uses mindfulness techniques to reduce stress associated with various medical conditions. Based in part, on this method, psychologist Zindel Segal (1956–), and his colleagues Mark Williams and John Teasdale, developed mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). It was first described in their book, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression in 2002. MBCT is an adjunctive (extra) or standalone form of treatment that emphasizes changing the awareness of, and relation to, thoughts, rather than changing thought content. It offers clients a different way of living with and experiencing emotional pain and distress. It fosters a detached attitude toward negative thinking and provides the skills to prevent escalation of negative thinking at times of potential relapse. Clients engage in various formal meditation practices





designed to increase moment-by-moment nonjudgmental awareness of physical sensations, thoughts, and feelings. Assigned homework includes practicing these exercises along with exercises designed to integrate application of awareness skills into daily life. Specific prevention strategies derived from traditional CBT methods are incorporated in the later weeks of the program.


Behavior therapy with children uses techniques of behavior modification to replace bad habits with acceptable ones.


• Antecedent is something that occurs before a behavior and includes places, people, and things involved in the environment.
• Behavior is an observable action demonstrated by a human being or an animal caused by either internal or external occurrences.
• Consequence is the result or outcome that occurs after a behavior is demonstrated.
• Reinforcement is the result of a behavior that will strengthen the likelihood of the behavior to happen again in the future.



The aim of behavior therapy with children is to identify and foster the development of personal coping strategies that can replace negative behaviors. The most effective treatments involve the child, parents, teachers, and therapists. All those involved must be taught by a trained therapist about which behavioral interventions are most effective.
   Behavior therapy with children focuses on three key elements, which are the antecedent, behavior, and consequence. In the field it is important to identify what happens right before, the antecedent, and after, the consequence, the behavior. This approach is referred to as the antecedent-behavior-consequence model of intervention. It is commonly used in behavior therapy with children to create effective programs at home, in school, and in the community.
   One subtype of behavior therapy commonly used with children is applied behavior analysis (ABA). It is one of the most well-researched and supported types of behavior therapy with children. Its goal is to help teach children a variety of ways of responding to challenges in a more positive way. In order to begin behavior therapy, several observations and assessment of a situation have to occur to help identify the function or the purpose of the behavior. Within ABA there are clearly identified reasons why behavior occurs. Some of these include a child’s need for attention, to escape, to gain access, and/or to satisfy a sense or physical response like pain. The goal of this therapy is to identify one or many of these reasons for behavior and replace negative behaviors with more positive ones. This occurs often through positive reinforcement, which helps to increase a desired behavior and decrease problem behavior.
   Another subset of behavior therapy is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), which focuses on helping children to identify and improve their thoughts and behaviors. CBT teaches children and teens how to recognize what might trigger undesirable responses and avoid those circumstances. This approach requires that a child have the ability to identify thoughts and consequences. Therefore, CBT can be most effectively used with older children and with parents who can be actively involved.





   In behavior therapy for children, several strategies are used. Modeling, role-playing, rehearsal, and rewards are some of them. As an example, role-playing is used to practice interaction with others around real issues in structured situations. This is one example of how children can learn that positive behaviors work and negative behaviors will not result in the same rewards.


One of the founders of behavior therapy with children is considered to be Dr. B. F. Skinner, who identified some of the basic theories of how we learn. Yet before him Dr. John B. Watson was one of the first clinicians to directly use behavior therapy with children in the 1920s. Dr. Watson studied the effects of behavioral conditioning on helping children with phobias or fears. In 1953, Skinner published his first influential book, Science and Human Behavior, which included his view on working with children.
   Until the late 1970s, behavior therapy was mostly applied in treatment with severely problematic children. Gradually, the work began to be applied to children with different ranges of cognitive and emotional problems. One great success has been in work with children diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, where behavior therapy can bring positive changes in social relationships and daily functioning. Behavior therapy has also been used extensively with children on the autism spectrum with positive results. Behavior therapy is proven to work on its own with several populations and groups of children with certain diagnoses. However, there are still cases where a combination of medication and therapy may help behavior changes occur more effectively. The focus of behavior therapy should always be on treating the child with respect and positive regard. A current focus in behavior therapy is on positive behavior systems and supports. This has helped to put behavior therapy with children into a better position for its introduction into schools and parenting. Many children with different issues benefit from behavior therapy, and it is considered one of the most helpful and effective treatments for young children with a range of challenges.



cally refer to ABA therapy as one of the most effective treatments for autism. In all cases, when therapy

is extended through training both parents and teachers, its benefits are seen in the entire family constellation as well as broadly in the school environment.


Today, the field of behavior therapy, especially in the forms of ABA and CBT, is a major part of the treatment protocols for child and adolescent psychology and psychiatry. Ensuring that the child gets the help appropriate to his or her age and circumstances is important in behavior therapy. The younger the child when treatment begins, the greater the chances of behavior

Behavioral activation is a brief, structured treatment approach that activates those who are depressed so they can again experience pleasure and satisfaction.


• Behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is psychotherapy approach that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as cognitive behavioral therapy.





• Cognitive therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing distorted thinking patterns.
• Depression is an emotional state that is characterized by feelings of low self-worth, guilt, and a reduced ability to enjoy life.
• Positive reinforcement is a way of increasing the strength of a given response by rewarding it.


Behavioral activation is a brief, behavioral treatment for depression that activates individuals in specific ways so they can again engage in pleasant activities. As a result they begin to reexperience pleasure and satisfaction and their depression lifts. Behavioral activation is based on a behavioral theory of depression. In this theory, as individuals become depressed, they increasingly withdraw from their environment, engage in escape behaviors, and disengage from their routines. Depression typically leads to withdrawal, avoidance, and inactivity. This prevents them from experiencing positive reinforcement that provides satisfaction and the desire to be active and involved. Over time, this avoidance exacerbates depressed mood, as individuals lose opportunities to be positively reinforced through pleasurable experiences and social activity, or experiences of mastery.
   Behavioral activation treatment is a set of techniques for helping individuals to overcome this pattern. Therapists help their clients to set weekly goals, to identify possible sources of positive reinforcement, and to schedule and structure their activities. Clients are encouraged to develop a list of activities that they enjoy or need to engage in as part of their normal life. Then, beginning with the easiest activities on the list, the individual agrees to carry them out in a systematic way. This reinstates contact with the naturally occurring positive reinforcement of the given activity, which in turn helps overcome the depressed mood.

In the mid-1970s, Peter M. Lewinsohn (1939–), an American psychologist, described a behavioral


theory of depression. He speculated that depression reflects low levels of positive reinforcement and high levels of aversive (negative) control. These were due to problems in the environment or to underdeveloped coping skills. Accordingly, he developed a treatment to increase pleasant activities for depressed individuals. As they engaged in an increasing number of pleasant activities, their rate of positive reinforcement began to increase. As activation increased, their symptoms of depression decreased. Unfortunately, his theory and approach was overshadowed in the 1980s and 1990s by the development of Aaron T. Beck’s (1921–), cognitive therapy (CT) approach for understanding and treating depression. CT and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) became known as the most effective treatments for depression. However, in 1996, psychologist Neil S. Jacobson (1949–1999) reported research on the effectiveness of CBT for depression. It showed no differences in treatment outcome between CBT and behavioral activation. A subsequent study showed that behavioral activation was as effective as antidepressant medications for mild to moderate depression. These and subsequent studies have led more therapists to use behavioral activation. Behavioral activation is utilized as either a standalone treatment or an adjunctive (additional) treatment combined with CT, CBT, or other approaches.






Behavioral assessment is a form of assessing an individual’s behaviors in a specific problem situation.

• Assessment is the measurement, observation, and systematic evaluation of an individual’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the actual problem situation.
• Traits are patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion, which are stable over time, differ across individuals, and influence behavior.


Behavioral assessment is an approach to assessment that focuses on overt behaviors and the identification of its antecedents (triggers) and consequences (effects) in a problematic situation. The purpose of this assessment is to devise a behavioral plan to correct the problem situation. Correctly identifying the antecedents and consequences points to the function or “why” of the behavior. Behavioral assessment involves observing or otherwise measuring an individual’s actual behavior in the specific settings where the individual experiences a behavioral difficulty. Once the behavior is defined and measured, careful consideration is given to factors that may be reinforcing and maintaining the behavior. Specific measures are selected based on the behavior and its context in order to analyze the target behavior prior to, during, and after. This information is used in developing a detailed plan containing strategies for changing or replacing the behavior.
Behavioral assessment typically involves one or
more behavioral interviews and observations, and includes direct observation and indirect methods. Direct observation focuses on a specific behavior: frequency (how often a behavior occurs), magnitude (how intense it is), and duration (how long it lasts). Direct observation often includes “anecdotal recording,” which involves recording a pattern of behavior using an antecedent-behavior-consequence format. In doing an anecdotal observation, the observer records


all behaviors observed, and what was observed to occur before and after the behaviors. For example, if a child is observed to slam the door to his or her bedroom, the observer should record “slammed bedroom door shut” rather than “child frustrated.” Then the observations are arranged into a chart which specifies behaviors, antecedents (what happened prior to the behavior), and consequences (what happened as a result of the behavior). Also tracked are the times at which behaviors were observed. Indirect methods include checklists and rating scales. Examples of checklists and rating scales used with children include the Revised Behavior Problem Checklist, the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, and the Behavior Evaluation Scale.


Behavioral assessment evolved from the field of behavior therapy as an alternative to traditional assessment approaches. Traditional assessment approaches were based on the trait model where inferred traits were used to explain and predict behavior of individuals across various contexts and situations. This model had limited utility for behavior therapists and researchers who viewed personality as the total of an individual’s habit patterns and behavior. They valued observable phenomena and verifiability of observations and subsequently developed behavioral assessment.
   There are two broad categories of behavioral assessment generally: clinical behavioral assessment and functional behavioral assessment (FBA). Clinical behavioral assessment is conducted for problem behaviors exhibited in home, school, work, or other settings, to provide a clear intervention plan for therapists, case managers, family members, or others who work with the individual being evaluated. FBA is an approach used with children who demonstrate chronic behavior problems. It focuses on patterns of behavior and the identification of their purpose or their function. For example, the function might be to avoid something, to get something, or to make something happen. The function is inferred from the carefully observed and analyzed sequence of behavior. FBAs are conducted by a school system when students with disabilities or suspected of having a disability are demonstrating





inappropriate behaviors. By federal law, school districts are required to perform FBAs as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.


Behavioral health is specialty area of health care that addresses the influence and effect of behavior on mental and physical well-being. Over the past decade, the term “behavioral health” is gradually replacing the term “mental health.” “Behavioral health” is a broad term that encompasses mental health, psychiatric, marriage and family counseling, and addiction treatment.

atrists, social workers, neurologists, and physicians.
   Behavioral health promotes a philosophy of health that emphasizes individual responsibility in the application of behavioral and biomedical science, knowledge, and techniques to the maintenance of health and the prevention of illness and dysfunction with self-initiated, health-enhancing activities. These activities include healthy eating, exercising, no smoking, positive attitude, and limited use of alcohol. Behavioral health is a specialty area of behavioral medicine.


Psychologist Joseph D. Matarazzo (1925–) first defined the health-care specialty of behavioral health in 1979. He distinguished it from the field of behavioral medicine, which was formally introduced in 1978 by the newly formed Society of Behavioral Medicine. Since then, much of the vision, training, clinical practice, and research on behavioral health and medical offset originated with psychologist Nicholas Cummings (1924–). Cummings is considered by many the father of behavioral health-care practice.
   Given the changes already noted, it appears that behavioral health practice will become a dominant force in health care. To the extent that behavioral health practice becomes the norm, the practice of





psychotherapy and psychological treatments within an integrated health-care setting will be notably different. Shorter and more focused psychological and psychotherapeutic interventions will replace the traditional 50-minute psychotherapy hour. As reimbursement shifts to favor integrated health care, increasing numbers of psychotherapists will work in primary care settings, with smaller numbers in clinics, agencies, or private practice.


• Interdisciplinary is the integration of two or more scientific or educational areas of knowledge.
• Rheumatic heart disease is a heart condition caused by rheumatic fever, which is triggered by a preventable infection. The disease is more prevalent in impoverished countries and communities.



Behavioral medicine is the interdisciplinary approach to understanding, preventing, diagnosing, and treating medical conditions with behavioral aspects.


• Behavioral describes the way someone responds to his or her environment. It is also referred to as psychological.
• Biomedical is the involvement of biological, medical, and physical sciences.
• Biopsychosocial refers to biological, psychological, and social factors.
• Cochrane Reviews are evidence-based reviews of health care and health policy research that addresses prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.

Behavioral medicine is the field of medicine that integrates behavioral and biomedical scientific knowledge. It focuses on the role that behavioral factors play in the cause, treatment, and prevention of medical conditions. It also promotes the communication of theory and research, and its application, among the professional fields, particularly medicine and psychology.
   The term “behavioral medicine” was first used in 1973 in the title of the book Biofeedback: Behavioral Medicine by psychiatrist Lee Birk (1936–2009). It was also used in the names of two organizations, Center for Behavioral Medicine and Study of Behavioral Medicine. The first definition of behavioral medicine was established in 1976 when psychologists Gary E. Schwartz (1944–) and Stephen Weiss held a conference at Yale University for a diverse group of behavioral and biomedical professionals. Together these scientists developed an interdisciplinary definition for the new field of behavioral medicine. They arrived at this definition: “Behavioral medicine is the field concerned with the development and integration of behavioral and biomedical science knowledge and techniques relevant to health and illness and the application of this knowledge and these techniques to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. Psychosis, neurosis and substance abuse are included only insofar as they contribute to physical disorders as an end point” (Schwartz and Weiss, 1977, 3). This definition focuses on health as well as illness. Schwartz and Weiss believed the integration of behavioral science and medicine would result in greater knowledge with broader application.
Two examples in which behavioral medicine is
used to study and treat physical illness are high blood pressure (hypertension) and rheumatic heart disease.





Behavioral medicine research incorporates the impact of biological, psychological, behavioral, social, environmental, and cultural influences on the occurrence, pattern, treatment, and management of these diseases. Behavioral medicine does not include research on mental illness (psychosis and neurosis), substance abuse, mental retardation, and social welfare issues 
   The advent of behavioral medicine promoted the development of interdisciplinary scientific journals that offer a central venue for behavioral and biomedical researchers to publish scientific findings. It also promoted the development of interdisciplinary organizations that united researchers, practitioners, and educators from different fields. The National Institutes of Health created the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research to coordinate research between the behavioral and social sciences. Finally, the Cochrane Collaboration acknowledged behavioral medicine as an evidence-based field and has included it in the resource database of the Cochrane Reviews.
   As far back as 1936, researchers have made the argument that psychosocial factors impact physical health and illness (Suls and Davidson, 2010), namely that psychological stress affects the cardiovascular, respiratory, muscular, metabolic, immune, and central nervous systems. Continuous psychological stress on these systems results in physical changes, which can negatively impact a person’s health.
   The significance of psychological influences on physical illness and the effects of physical illness on psychological factors illustrate the reciprocal relationship between the mind and body. Behavioral medicine research has several implications for mental health practitioners. First, psychological factors such as anxiety, fear, stress, and self-efficacy impact physical health and behavior. Second an integrative approach from a biopsychosocial perspective is necessary to comprehensively assess, diagnose, and treat individuals. Third, socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity impact health outcomes and must also be considered during assessment, diagnosis, and treatment.


The Bender Gestalt Test is a widely used assessment tool for measuring cognitive abilities and assessing brain dysfunction. It is also known as the Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test.


• Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative medical condition that adversely affects the brain and causes dementia within the later years of life.
• Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a condition involving hyperactivity in children, characterized by an inability to concentrate and inappropriate or impulsive behaviors.
• Autism is a neurological condition that usually begins before the age of three years and develops with respect to disorders involving speech and language, interpretation of the world, social interactions and the formation of relationships, and reaction to stimuli. Repetitive behaviors are often seen within the condition.
• Visuomotor refers to visual and motor processes.


The Bender Gestalt Test (BGT), also called the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, is a psychological





assessment tool used to evaluate visual-motor functioning and visual perception skills in children and adults. The test requires fine motor skills, the ability to discriminate between varying elements of visual stimuli, the capacity to integrate visual skills with motor skills, and the ability to shift attention from the original design to what is being drawn. The test-taker is instructed to reproduce (copy) simple figures (geometric designs) on a blank piece of paper as well as he or she can. Usually it takes from 7 to 10 minutes to complete. Scores are based on accuracy of the resultant figures and other such relevant factors. The BGT can identify possible organic brain damage and the degree of maturation of the nervous system. It is used to evaluate visual-motor maturity and integration skills, style of responding, reaction to frustration, ability to correct mistakes, planning and organizational skills, and motivation. It is also used within inpatient psychiatric units to differentiate between serious mental disorders and brain impairment.


The BGT was developed by Lauretta Bender, MD (1897–1987), an American child psychiatrist. Bender published the monograph A Visual Motor Gestalt and Its Clinical Use in 1935. The original test contains nine geometric figures drawn in black. These figures are presented to the test-taker one at a time, who is asked to copy the unique figure onto a blank sheet of paper with the card still in sight. They are allowed to erase but cannot use rulers or other aids.
   The second edition of the Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test (Bender-Gestalt II) was published in 2003. It contains 16 figures and has a new recall procedure for visual-motor (visuomotor) memory that provides a more comprehensive assessment of these skills. It also includes supplemental tests of simple motor and perceptual ability to aid in identifying motor-visual deficits. Furthermore, new norms are provided for copy and recall procedures. The main test takes between 5 and 10 minutes to administer, with an additional 5 minutes to complete each of the supplemental visual and motor tests.
   The Bender-Gestalt II is used to assess the maturation of visuomotor perceptions of children and


adults from age 3 to 85 years. It is useful in assessing various neuropsychological psychological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, giftedness, and intellectual and learning disabilities. It is also useful in identifying cognitive decline in older adults. Overall, the Bender-Gestalt II remains a popular psychological test because it is simple to use, is brief to administer, and has proven effective for a wide range of ages.



Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that slow the nervous system functioning and are prescribed to relieve nervousness and tension, to induce sleep, and to treat other symptoms. They are highly addictive.


• Antianxiety medications are prescribed drugs that relieve anxiety symptoms. They are also called anxiolytics or tranquilizers.


Benzodiazepines are a class of antianxiety medications that work by slowing the central nervous system functioning. Although anxiety is a normal response to stressful situations, some have elevated levels of anxiety that interfere with daily living. Benzodiazepines help reduce anxious feelings and also relieve other troubling symptoms of anxiety, such as increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, irritability, nausea, and faintness. Other uses of benzodiazepines are for muscle





spasms, epilepsy and other seizure disorders, phobias, panic disorder, withdrawal from alcohol, and sleeping problems. However, this medicine should not be used every day for sleep problems that last more than a few days. If used this way, the drug loses its effectiveness within a few weeks. The class of antianxiety drugs known as benzodiazepines includes Xanax, Librium, Valium, and Ativan. The antianxiety effect of this class of medications is experienced shortly after they are taken, typically within 15–60 minutes, depending on the specific medication.

Some benzodiazepines increase the likelihood of birth defects, and their use during pregnancy can cause dependency and withdrawal symptoms in the infant. Because benzodiazepines may pass into breast milk, women who are breast-feeding should not use this class of medications without checking with their physicians. Benzodiazepines have considerable addictive. Anesthetics, including those used for dental procedures. The combined effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol can result in unconsciousness or even death. Warning signs of this interaction include slurred speech or confusion, severe drowsiness, staggering, and profound weakness.


Bereavementtial, and long-term use of benzodiazepines may result		
in dependence and tolerance, so it is important that

their use be monitored by the prescribing practitioner. The most common side effects are dizziness, light-headedness, drowsiness, clumsiness, unsteadiness, and slurred speech. These problems commonly resolve as the body adjusts to the medication. They do not require medical treatment unless they persist or interfere with normal activities. More serious, but less common side effects include behavior changes, confusion, depression, difficulty concentrating, hallucinations, involuntary movements of the body, memory problems, seizures, or yellow skin or eyes. Medical attention should be sought if these appear. Those who have taken benzodiazepines for a prolonged period or at high doses may notice side effects for several weeks after they stop taking the drug. They should check with their physicians if the following symptoms occur: irritability, nervousness, or sleep problems.
   Benzodiazepines interact with other central nervous system drugs and alcohol to further slow central nervous system functioning. These drugs include antihistamines, allergy medicine, cold medicine, muscle relaxants, seizure medications, sleep aids, and some pain relievers. They may also increase the effects of

Bereavement is an individual’s emotional reaction to the loss (death) of a loved one.


• Bereavement counseling is a type of counseling that assists individuals in coping with grief following the death of a loved one or any major life transition that results in grief. It is also called grief counseling.
• Complicated grief is the type of grief that is unresolved after an extended period of time and does not follow the typical progression that occurs in common grief reactions.
• Derealization is a perceptual reaction in which an individual becomes convinced that life or others are not real.
• DSM-5 is the abbreviation for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders.





• Five stages of grief are the stages that individuals often experience after the death of a loved one or even after a non-death-related loss. The stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

Bereavement Counseling

can vary greatly from person to person, and grief also	
has a cultural influence. Typical reactions that occur during bereavement are sadness, difficulty concentrating, anger, guilt, temporary decline in daily functioning, derealization, isolation, and frequent crying. The DSM-5 identifies bereavement as a V-code. Resolution of bereavement-related symptoms occurs over a few months, but when symptoms persist, it is called complicated grief.
   Bereavement reactions can also occur after a non-death type of loss, for example, a divorce, the loss of functioning of one’s legs, or acute illness of a loved one. In 1969, psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (1926–2004) identified the “five stages of grief” in her book On Death and Dying. The stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Her research examined the emotional reactions of patient facing terminal cancer or other illnesses, and she described the five stages based on her observations of her patients’ experience of grief. Sometimes, individuals do not experience the stages in a linear fashion. Some switch between several stages multiple times, while others may not experience anger or bargaining at all.

Bereavement counseling is used with clients who have lost a person or animal due to death. It is often used when a person experiences grief-related behaviors or thoughts that are extremely distressing and are impacting his or her daily functioning. This type of counseling aims to assist individuals in moving from bereavement through resolution or acceptance of the loss. This process is typically done through counseling, by assisting the client in processing his or her emotions and other reactions to the loss. Some common grief presentations that are treated in bereavement counseling include sadness, difficulty concentrating, anger, guilt, temporary decline in daily functioning, derealization, isolation, and frequent crying. Resolution of bereavement-related symptoms typically occurs over a matter of a few months, but when symptoms persist, it is called complicated grief. Complicated grief can occur due to trauma, if the client has a personality disorder, or if the client lacks some of the coping skills or resources to manage grief. Typically bereavement counseling is done in a brief therapy setting, while complicated grief is often done in a long-term setting.
   The DSM-5 only lists bereavement as a "condition for further study." Bereavement symptoms may mimic different depressive disorders, but they often pass within a few months and do not meet full criteria for a depressive disorder. When an individual experiences severe and enduring depressive symptoms during bereavement, he or she will be a likely candidate for bereavement counseling. In addition, individuals with a predisposition to depression are vulnerable to experiencing significant challenges with bereavement or major episodes of depression.
   Bereavement counseling assists clients through the different stages of grief. One model that explains


the grief process was created by psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (1926–2004). She identified the “five stages of grief” in her book On Death and Dying. The five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Her research examined the emotional reactions of clients facing terminal cancer or other illnesses. It is important to note that the individuals do not experience the stages in a linear fashion, as some individuals will switch between several stages multiple times, while others may not experience anger or bargaining at all. In bereavement counseling, the counselor will seek to assess the client’s coping skills and symptoms, while aiming to work with the client in moving toward the acceptance stage of grief and at least improved daily functioning. Some clients may grieve for several months, while others may grieve for over a year. Others may grieve for many years with very little improvement.
   Bereavement counseling may also be used when a client is aware that he or she or a loved one will likely experience death due to a terminal illness or severe injury. This type of grief is called anticipatory grief, which occurs when a client experiences grief before a loved one dies. Clients may seek counseling services shortly after news of a loved one’s terminal illness and likely probability of death as a result.




Best practices are methods that have consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means and that are used as benchmarks.






• Accountability is the expectation or requirement to conduct evaluations and report performance information.
• Benchmark is a standard by which a product or clinical activity can be measured or evaluated.
• Evidence-based practice is a form of practice that is based on the integration of the best research evidence with clinical expertise and client values.
• Health Maintenance Organization is an organization that provides or arranges managed care.
• Managed care is a system of health care that controls costs by placing limits on physicians’ fees and by restricting access to certain medical procedures and providers.
• Practice is a method or process used to accomplish a goal or objective.

Best practices are methods, procedures, or processes that have been proven to be superior to other methods, procedures, or processes. Benchmarking is a means of comparing various methods and is essential in creating new best practices. Best practices come about when better ways of doing things are discovered. Regular use of best practices leads to consistent outcomes. Best practices improve the quality of a process, and consistency is improved through their use. While the term “best practices” begins in business settings, it is increasingly common in health and mental health settings.

The development of best practices in health and mental health care has its roots in managed care. In 1973, the U.S. Congress mandated changes in health care that led to the creation and adoption of best practices. The goal of best practices in business is


to increase process efficiency and profit margins. In contrast, the goal of best practices in health and mental health care is to improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs.
   Several changes in mental health and psychological services in the United States have occurred in the past two decades. Many of these changes are the result of the increasing expectation for accountability. Increasingly, medical and psychological practice has become more accountable and evidence based. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine defined evidence-based practice (EBP) in medicine as the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values. In 2005, the American Psychological Association modified that definition by including client characteristics, culture, and preferences.
   It should be noted that EBP is broader than the concept of best practices because it explicitly considers research evidence, client values, and clinician expertise, that is, utilizing clinical skills and past experience to rapidly identify the client’s health status, diagnosis, risks and benefits, and personal values and expectations. The current status of best practice is directly related to EBP.



Beyond Freedom and Dignity is a book written by Dr. B. F. Skinner that highlights his ideas about human behavior and the process of changing human behavior.





Beyond Freedom and Dignity is the name of a book written by American psychologist B. F. Skinner and was first published in 1971. The book challenges the concept of dignity, which Skinner refers to as free will and moral individuality. Instead of the traditional idea that based human choice and development on morality, he took a different approach. He used scientific methods to modify behavior for the purpose of building a happier and better-organized society.
   Expanding on the ideas of John B. Watson, Skin-ner’s research led him to believe that human beings are not independent of their physical, social, and cultural environment. He argued that human free will is both false and misleading. This is because Skinner demonstrated that human behavior could be manipulated through both negative and positive reinforcements. In the book he hopes to teach people that we are fooled if we think humans have freedom and free will. He was one of the first people to use applied behavior analysis to understand human development. He placed this in the context of Individual Psychology as it applies to the environment and people collectively. Beyond Freedom and Dignity portrayed these concepts and helped society become aware of human behavior and ways to be as productive as possible in changing it.
Through scientific research he claimed that behavior is based on rewards or punishments.
   Perhaps helped by a negative reaction to the freedom movement of the late 1960s, Skinner’s ideas presented in Beyond Freedom and Dignity struck a chord with many people. This included psychologists, who believed that environment and genetics were important because they molded human decision making. The widespread popularity of the ideas Skinner wrote about in this book helped reinforce a behaviorist approach. This happened within the field of psychology but also in the fields of education and business. The importance of both positive and negative environments in shaping how decisions are made contradicted the concept of free will.

The central insight of behaviorism is the awareness that our activities and choices are heavily influenced by social and environmental factors. This includes things that are rewarding and discouraging. Beyond Freedom and Dignity helped popularize the concept, and its principles continue to be represented in higher education.
   Although many disliked Skinner’s approach, his ideas remain central to the way we understand human

Bibliotherapy is an adjunct to psychological treatment, particularly psychotherapy, which incorporates written materials that are read outside of treatment sessions.


• Adjunct is a form of treatment that, while not required, can be helpful to the treatment process.
• Agoraphobia is anxiety about or avoidance of places or situations from which escape may be difficult or help might not be available in the event of having panic symptoms.
• Cognitive behavioral therapy is a form of psychotherapy that emphasizes the correction of distorted thinking patterns and change of maladaptive behaviors.
• Psychoeducation is a component of many psychological treatments in which patients are provided knowledge about their psychological condition, its causes, and how a particular treatment might reduce their symptoms and/or increase their functioning.






Bibliotherapy is a form of treatment in which structured readings are used as an adjunct to psychological treatments, particularly psychotherapy. These readings, including biographies, workbooks, and short stories, are used to reinforce learning or insights gained in the therapy. They can also provide additional professional resources to foster personal growth and development. Bibliotherapy has been utilized in a variety of treatment settings for various psychological conditions, including eating disorders, depression, bipolar disorders, agoraphobia, alcohol and substance disorders, and stress-related health conditions.
   The goal of bibliotherapy is to increase the patient’s understanding of his or her condition or problem that requires treatment. The written materials are used to educate the patient about the condition itself and to increase the patient’s acceptance of a proposed treatment. Commonly, reading about one’s condition outside of the therapy sessions encourages more active participation in the treatment process and fosters personal responsibility for recovery. Many patients are relieved to learn that others have had the same condition or problem and have been able to successfully cope with or recover from it. Therapists who prescribe bibliotherapy often find that it accelerates treatment progress.
   Commonly, bibliotherapy is used as an adjunct to conventional psychotherapy approaches. It is commonly used in cognitive behavior therapy in the developing individualized treatment plans and workbooks for specific disorders. For example, patients with eating disorders, especially bulimia nervosa, can benefit from reading educational information appropriate to their stage of recovery, such as books or articles about cultural biases regarding weight, attractiveness, and dieting. Such information can help patients better understand the rationale for their treatment. In this regard, bibliotherapy is similar to psychoeducation.
Developments and Current Status
For many, written material can reinforce their commitment to getting better. Those who lack the time or finances to participate in weekly psychotherapy sessions may often find that bibliotherapy can bridge the gap between less frequently scheduled appointments. For those


experiencing agoraphobia or similar psychological conditions that can preclude in-office treatment, bibliotherapy can be most beneficial. Research indicates that it can be highly effective in helping individuals with agoraphobia better understand and cope with their symptoms. As with any form of treatment, bibliotherapy is effective to the extent to which it actively engages the patient’s desire and readiness for change. The use of bibliotherapy in the form of additional information and workbooks can greatly reinforce the patient’s commitment to change.




Binge drinking is an irregular episode of heavy alcohol consumption.


• Alcohol abuse disorder is a mental disorder involving a pattern of problematic alcohol use that leads to significant problems for the user.
• Alcohol intoxication is the impairment of ability following the ingestion of alcohol.
• Alcoholism is a general term for the compulsive and uncontrolled consumption of alcohol to the detriment of the drinker’s health, relationships, and social standing.
• Standard drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor.





Binge drinking describes intermittent episodes of excessive drinking that result in alcohol intoxication. The amount of alcohol considered to be excessive in one episode is five standard drinks for men and four for women. Although individuals who binge drink may drink in excess regularly, usually this is not on a daily basis. In contrast, excessive drinking on a daily basis is likely to result in an alcohol abuse disorder or alcoholism.
   Binge drinking is most common among young adults, particularly men rather than women. The likelihood of individuals’ binge drinking increases if they are college students. This is especially true if they are involved with a fraternity or sorority. It follows that young adults who value “partying” in college also tend to binge drink more than those who do not. A large survey of college students (Courtney and Polich, 2009) found that 44% qualified as binge drinkers. In addition, there is a correlation between those who begin

to drink in high school and those who binge drink in early adulthood.
   Although this behavior may or may not qualify as alcohol abuse disorder, there are often significant consequences to binge drinking. One of the most likely outcomes is significant impairment of judgment. As a result, binge drinking individuals may act in unusual, harmful, or dangerous ways. For example, drunk driving and unprotected sex may be caused by alcohol intoxication and binge drinking. Furthermore, the consequences of binge drinking are considered to be the leading cause of injury and death in college students in the United States. These are most likely to occur because of car accidents.


Binge drinking in itself is not considered a medical condition or mental disorder. Therefore, there is no formal treatment for binge drinking. However, on college campuses prevention programs are commonly





used to control this behavior. Another approach is to increase enforcement of the legal drinking age. These programs are generally ineffective.


Binge eating disorder is a mental disorder characterized by binge eating without subsequent purging episodes.


• Addiction is a persistent, compulsive dependence on a substance or a behavior.
• Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by refusal to maintain minimal normal body weight along with a fear of weight gain and a distorted body image.
• Bariatric surgery is a surgical procedure on the stomach and/or intestines to help those who are extremely obese lose weight. It is also called weight loss surgery.
• Binge eating is a pattern of disordered eating consisting of episodes of uncontrolled intake of food.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of counseling or psychotherapy that focuses on changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as CBT.
• Eating disorder is a class of mental disorders that are characterized by difficulties with too much, too little, or unhealthy food intake and may include distorted body image.


• Obesity is an excessive accumulation of body fat, usually 20% or more over an individual’s ideal body weight.


Binge eating is central to this disorder, and it involves eating a large quantity of food in a short time. Individuals with binge eating disorder binge regularly for several months. They believe that they cannot control their eating at the time and feel unhappy and upset about it afterward. Binge episodes are experienced as a type of out-of-body or trance-like experience where the individuals with this disorder experience a loss of control. Individuals with this disorder seem to live from one diet to another and are preoccupied with the need to lose and maintain weight loss. They are often extremely embarrassed by weight gain and are likely to isolate themselves from others.
   Binge eating is also central to another eating disorder called bulimia nervosa. But it differs in that those with binge eating disorder do not use purging methods like vomiting or laxatives. Typically, this disorder often leads to obesity. But it also occurs in normal-weight individuals. Obese individuals suffer significantly more medical challenges, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), stroke, heart disease, sleep problems, type 2 diabetes, colon cancer, and breast cancer. Individuals engaging in binge eating often look to diets to help control binge eating.
   Binge eating disorder is more prevalent in females but occurs more often in males than do other eating disorders. It is common in individuals who seek treatment for weight loss. Often the client lacks awareness of the psychological or psychiatric components of the disorder. Binge eating is also seen in many seeking bariatric surgery. This disorder usually begins in adolescence and does tend to run in families.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a pattern of consuming excessive amounts of food in a relatively short amount of time (two hours or less) and engage in this bingeing behavior one or more times per week for at least a three-month period of time. A binge is an isolated period of eating in which the





individual ingests enormous amounts of food, often at a rapid rate, eating to the point of physical discomfort. While it might be a common experience to witness one or two relatives engaging in binge eating at events like Thanksgiving dinner, the binge eating disorder involves engaging in this type of overeating from 1 to over 14 times per week. Individuals experience the binge as an “out of personal control” experience unrelated to the feeling of hunger. Bingeing often occurs in isolation due to embarrassment regarding the amount of food ingested and is usually accompanied by intense feelings of guilt. Binge eating is diagnosed if the binge occurs without purging and is not an active component of eating disorders like bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa. The degree of severity in binge eating ranges from mild with one to three episodes per week to extreme with 14 or more (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is not well understood. However, it appears to run in families, which may suggest a genetic predisposition to addiction (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Cultural attitudes about body shape and weight also appear to play a role. Long-term dieting as well as psychological issues appear to increase the risk of this disorder. More specifically, stress, anxiety, and depression can lead to binge eating.


The goals for treatment for this disorder are to reduce eating binges, to improve emotional well-being, and, often, to lose weight. Because it typically involves shame, poor self-image, self-disgust, and other negative emotions, counseling is directed at addressing these and other psychological issues. Most commonly, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), in individual and/ or group sessions, is the mainstay of treatment. CBT typically focuses on the situations and issues that trigger binge eating episodes. These include negative feelings about one’s body or a depressed mood. If obesity is involved, weight loss counseling is used in addition to CBT. Medication may also play a role in the treatment of this disorder. While no medication is specifically designed to treat binge eating disorder, antidepressants such as Prozac can reduce the urge to binge


and treat associated symptoms like anxiety and depression. When bipolar disorder or a personality disorder is present, treatment is more challenging and may require hospitalization.




Like any other skill, individuals can learn how to regulate certain unconscious reactions in their bodies. For example, any person—even children—can master how to regulate body temperature with his or her mind. In fact, with proper training, a person can learn how to regulate his or her breathing, muscle tension, heart rate, blood pressure, and even brain waves. To learn these mind–body skills, individuals require the proper instruction and minute-to-minute updates on their bodies’ current status. Biofeedback provides this constant stream of information. These streaming updates are critical for a person to understand how his or her body reacts to certain stimuli.


Biofeedback is both the process and device used to train individuals to regulate their own physiologic functions. By giving the individual constant, moment-to-moment updates on specific physiologic functions like heart rate and breathing, this therapy allows him or her to master control over what would otherwise be unconscious bodily reactions.








   Biofeedback is a noninvasive therapy that allows a patient to take control of his or her own well-being. It sharpens the mind’s hold over various reactions in the body. Through a series of specialized trainings, biofeedback allows an individual to recognize how certain thoughts, situations, or emotions may trigger unhealthy spikes in heart rate, stress levels, blood pressure, or surface temperature.
   These biofeedback treatments (or trainings) are focused on the individual. Every patient is different and therefore learns at a different rate and responds to different stimuli. When undergoing biofeedback therapy, a patient is connected to specialized biofeedback equipment that gives the patient constant visual or auditory signals about bodily reactions. In other words,

patients see and hear in real time how their bodies are reacting to various situations.
   With this constant stream of information, patients can be trained to manage these reactions. Like physical therapy, patients are encouraged to train and practice at these sessions with a specialized therapist to control these reactions. Through constant repetition, almost anyone can master this type of training, which is why biofeedback is often compared to other trainable skills like learning a language or learning to catch a ball.
   One of the most common forms of biofeedback is surface electromyography, which is used to treat many different conditions including chronic pain and joint dysfunction. Other biofeedback instruments





include electrodermographs, capnometers, feedback thermometers, electrocardiographs, rheoencephalographs, electroencephalograph or “neurofeedback,” and photoplethysmographs, which treat a wide range of conditions.


Biofeedback has been extremely effective in helping patients overcome all kinds of disorders, injuries, and conditions. Various biofeedback treatments have been known to help improve patients’ memory, sleeping, muscle pain, tension headaches, migraines, anxiety, stress levels, attention-deficit disorder, urinary incontinence, epilepsy, Raynaud’s disease, and phantom limb pain, among others.
   Studies have shown that biofeedback can assist with learning and other cognitive functions. For example, one study demonstrated how college students used biofeedback to improve their academic performance. Another study showed how a portable biofeedback device allowed a soldier to overcome his insomnia in the middle of a warzone. Other studies show that biofeedback allowed children with various mental handicaps to improve their IQs.
   Other studies still show that biofeedback can help adults—and even possibly adolescents—overcome addictions to alcohol, opiates, or other illegal substances. Interestingly, in one study, biofeedback doubled the recovery rate of drug dependence, and it also improved test subjects’ ability to process information and focus their attention.
   Biofeedback both is noninvasive and poses no known risks to the individual. In fact, biofeedback is often used successfully when other treatments or medications have failed. It’s also used on pregnant or nursing women who cannot take other medications.
   One drawback to biofeedback is the expense. Biofeedback devices and treatment can be costly. However, as technology is improving, new lower-cost options are becoming available, including some portable biofeedback devices that patients can use at home.
   As a modern practice, biofeedback dates back to the mid-20th century. The term “biofeedback” itself was coined in 1969—at the same conference where


the Bio-Feedback Research Society first formed. However, some researchers maintain that biofeedback actually began over a century ago in India with certain ancient forms of Yoga and breathing exercises that mimic modern biofeedback.
   Today, biofeedback continues to offer solutions for patients with many different conditions. At the same time, biofeedback also gives patients some measure of control over their own health and wellness.





Biopsychosocial model is a way of thinking about health and illness in terms of biological, psychological, and social factors rather than purely in biological terms.


• Biomedical model of health and disease focuses primarily on biological factors and excludes psychological, environmental, and social influences.
• Biochemical marker is any substance in the urine, blood, or other bodily fluids that serves as an indicator of a medical condition.
• Interdisciplinary refers to the integration of two or more academic disciplines.
• Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that affects behavior, thinking, and emotions, which make distinguishing between real and unreal experiences difficult.

Biopsychosocial model is a way of integrating biological, psychological, and social factors to better understand an individual’s experience of disease and illness. This model is used in many fields such as psychiatry, clinical psychology, health psychology, counseling, medicine, nursing, sociology, and clinical social work. The “biopsychosocial model” was originally developed in 1980 by American psychiatrist George L. Engel (1913–1999), who viewed people as “united, biopsychosocial persons” rather than “biomedical persons” (Dowling, 2005, 2039). Engel promoted the movement from a purely medical model of disease that focuses on biological factors to a biopsychosocial model that incorporates psychological and social factors as well as biological variables. Under the medical model, both physical disease (diabetes) and mental illness ( schizophrenia) are attributed to the dysfunction of core physical processes. From a biological standpoint, laboratory tests can detect and confirm diabetes or schizophrenia in a person; however, that person may not be experiencing any symptoms and may be completely


unaware of any problem. When symptoms begin and how they are physically expressed is influenced by the interaction of psychological, social, and cultural factors with biological factors. The severity of a disease is also impacted from a combination of these factors. Psychological and social factors influence when, or even if, a person seeks medical care. Proper medical treatment may manage or eliminate a disease or illness but may not necessarily restore health. In this case, psychological and social influences may be operating as obstacles to the achievement of health. Also affecting the achievement of health is the quality of the patient–doctor relationship and the patient’s trust in the physician.
   The biomedical model does not take into account variables that aid in the explanation and treatment of mental illness. Engel’s biopsychosocial model provides a framework to understand what causes disease and illness, why it appears when it does, the severity of the disease or illness, and how to treat it. It also takes into account the role of the physician and the entire health-care structure. This model helps explain why two people diagnosed with the same disease (measured by biochemical markers) may experience two very different health outcomes. One individual may consider his or her condition to be severe and experience distressing symptoms, while the other may view his or her condition to be mild and experience little symptom distress. The biopsychosocial model has implications for mental health practitioners and the entire health-care structure. First, it suggests that the treatment of disease and illness necessitates the collaboration of an interdisciplinary team of practitioners from both the medical and mental health fields. Second, the biopsychosocial approach requires practitioners from different fields to understand the interrelationship of physical, psychological, and social factors, and incorporate them throughout the treatment process. This model illustrates that physical and psychological factors may be indirectly affected through health behaviors (e.g., sedentary lifestyle, excessive alcohol use, poor nutrition) and biological factors (e.g., diabetes). Third, practitioners must keep in mind that a purely medical model approach could lead to misdiagnosis. For example, a biochemical measure, such as a blood test, may indicate normal sugar levels in a sick patient or abnormal sugar levels in a healthy patient. Finally, the biopsychosocial





model is the basis for behavioral medicine, which is the interdisciplinary approach to understanding, preventing, diagnosing, and treating medical conditions with behavioral aspects. Len Sperry (1943–), a physician and psychologist, has described a treatment approach based on this model called biopsychosocial therapy.




Biopsychosocial therapy is an integrative approach to planning and implementing psychological treatment when biological factors are present along with psychological and sociocultural factors.

Definitions
• Biopsychosocial perspective is a way of thinking about health and illness in terms of biological, psychological, and social factors rather than purely in biological terms. It is also referred to as the biopsychosocial model.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Vulnerability refers to an individual’s unique susceptibility to develop a medical or psychological condition or express symptoms based on the individual’s genes and psychological history.


Biopsychosocial therapy is an integrative approach to planning and implementing psychological treatment which attends to biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. Rather than being a “new” treatment or psychotherapy approach, it is a set of strategies for planning and implementing effective treatment interventions within a biopsychosocial (BPS) perspective. It uses basic treatment strategies and treatment tactics to tailor (customize) treatment to the particular needs of clients. Because of its comprehensive and integrative emphasis, biopsychosocial therapy is particularly useful with difficult, treatment-resistant situations or where a medical conation complicates psychiatric (mental) conditions. These include chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, cancer, and chronic fatigue syndrome. It includes depression and anxiety disorders that have not responded to conventional treatment. Also included are comorbid (simultaneous presence) conditions such as substance disorders with an anxiety disorder or heart disease with clinical depression.
Biopsychosocial therapy is based on the BPS perspective. This perspective is an integrative and comprehensive way of thinking about and treating medical and psychological conditions. Since then, it has increasingly influenced the fields of medicine, psychiatry, psychology, social work, and counseling. This perspective emphasizes three sets of vulnerabilities and resources: the biological, the psychological, and the sociocultural domains. In this perspective, stressors, client vulnerabilities and resources, and levels of functioning or impairments are central factors. Four basic premises underlie this perspective. First, a client’s problems are best understood in terms of multi-causation involving biological, psychological, and social factors rather than a single etiology. Second, a client’s problems are best understood in terms of a client’s biological, psychological, and social vulnerabilities. Third, a client’s problems are best understood as manifestations of the client’s attempts to cope with stressors (biological, psychological, interpersonal, or environmental) given his or her vulnerabilities and resources. Finally, multimodal interventions are used to effect change.
The treatment process includes four phases: engagement, assessment, intervention, and maintenance/termination. Tailoring treatment to the individual’s need is essential at each phase. First, the individual is engaged in the treatment process. Second, an assessment is made of the individual’s symptoms and maladaptive pattern. Third, interventions focus on modifying maladaptive patterns and achieving some integration of the chronic illness within the patient’s expanded self-conception, such that the illness becomes a part of the self but does not fully define the self. Finally, the focus shifts to maintaining the change and, when appropriate, reducing the individual’s reliance on the treatment relationship.


The BPS perspective was first proposed by psychiatrist George L. Engel (1913–1999) in a 1977 article in Science, where he described the need for a new medical model or perspective. He argued that the biomedical model had proved inadequate in the effective treatment of many patients with medical and psychiatric conditions. Instead, he outlined the BPS model.
   Biopsychosocial therapy was formally described and articulated by psychiatrist Len Sperry in 1988 in an article entitled “Biopsychosocial Therapy: An Integrative Approach for Tailoring Treatment.” Subsequent articles and books have elaborated this approach and its clinical applications.
   The BPS perspective assumes that treatment of medical and mental conditions requires that clinicians (physicians, nurses, psychotherapists) address the biological, psychological, and social influences on a patient’s functioning. The reason is that the workings of the body can affect the mind, just as the workings of the mind can affect the body. This means both a direct interaction between mind and body and indirect effects through intermediate factors. A growing body of scientific research indicates that patients’ perceptions of health and threat of disease influence the likelihood that they will engage in health-promoting or treatment behaviors. These include taking medication, eating healthy foods, and engaging in physical activity. Research also suggests that when clinicians frame treatment recommendations in a BPS perspective, patients are more likely to better understand and follow such recommendations.


   A noticeable shift is under way from a strictly biomedical perspective to a BPS perspective. The trend in U.S. health care is toward integrative care, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act. This focus on integrative services means that clinicians will gather more BPS information from their patients. Integration of professional services through integrated health teams means that patients’ psychological and sociocultural needs will be addressed in addition to their biological needs. Members of integrative health teams (nurses, nutritionists, health psychologists, social workers, and professional counselors) will address all three aspects of the BPS perspective. This will allow physicians to focus primarily on biological factors.



Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a history of manic or hypomanic episodes, usually with one or more major depressive episodes.

• Bipolar and related disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by changes in mood and in energy (e.g., being highly irritable and impulsive while not needing sleep). These disorders include bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder.





• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Cyclothymic disorder is a mental disorder characterized by alternating cycles of hypomanic and depressive periods with symptoms like those of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder but of lesser severity.
• Depression is a sad mood or emotional state that is characterized by feelings of low self-worth or guilt and a reduced ability to enjoy life. It is not considered a mental disorder unless it significantly disrupts the individual’s daily functioning.
• Depressive disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a sad or irritable mood and cognitive and physical changes that significantly disrupt the individual’s daily functioning. These disorders include major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
• Depressive phase is a mental state characterized by sad mood, reduced ability to enjoy life, and decreased energy or activity seen during the course of a bipolar disorder.
• Hypomania is a mental state similar to mania but less intense.
• Major depressive disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a depressed mood and other symptoms that interfere significantly with an individual’s daily functioning. It is also referred to as clinical depression.
• Mania is a mental state of expansive, elevated, or irritable mood with increased energy or activity.
• Manic phase is a mental state characterized by expansive, elevated, or irritable mood with increased energy or activity seen during the course of a bipolar disorder.


• SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. They are a class of antidepressant medications that work by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin in nerve cells and raising its level in the brain.

Bipolar disorder is one of a group of bipolar and related disorders. It is characterized by manic or hypomanic episodes, usually with one or more major depressive episodes that cause clinically significant distress or disrupt everyday functioning. This disorder is often not recognized or is misdiagnosed as major depressive disorder by mental health professionals. Early in its course, bipolar disorder may masquerade as poor school or work performance or as alcohol or drug abuse problem. If left untreated, it tends to worsen and the individual experiences episodes of full-blown mania or depression. Bipolar disorder is a chronic condition. Research indicates that more than half of those diagnosed with this disorder had four or more episodes of mania and depression (Goodwin and Jamison, 1990). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), describes two variants of this disorder: bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. Each will be described separately along with its diagnostic features.
Bipolar I disorder. Individuals with this type of bipolar disorder experience periods of mania followed by periods of depression. During the manic phase, they display considerable enthusiasm, hopefulness, confidence, and expansive self-esteem, often to the point of grandiosity. They tend to act impulsively while their thinking is expansive and creative, but distracted. Their enthusiasm contributes to sleeplessness, pressured speech, and increased social participation and to extreme choices that would not be made during non-manic periods. These symptoms reflect the individual’s efforts to overcome challenges and create feelings of worth and excitement. While these manic episodes appear to neutralize their underlying discouragement, they create other problems. Largely this is because of their failure to consider the consequences of their actions during these manic periods. This failure





later seems to contribute to intensified periods of hopelessness and despair and the inevitable depressive episode that follows.
   According to the DSM-5, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit episodes of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood along with persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy. These episodes last for at least one week and are present most of the day. The mania itself includes elevated self-esteem and grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, flight of ideas or sense of racing thoughts, distractibility, and goal-directed behaviors and engagement in activities that have the potential for painful consequences. These symptoms must be significantly distressing and impair the individual’s ability to function in important areas of life. Furthermore, these episodes cannot have been caused by substance use or a medical condition or another mental disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Bipolar II disorder. The primary difference between
bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder is the extent of the mania. Bipolar II is characterized by hypomania, which includes less extreme periods of manic features. Why do some individuals exhibit hypomania instead of mania? It may be that those with this bipolar II have a greater awareness of the potential consequences of their actions. This awareness may serve to inhibit the mania. Maybe their ambitions are not as lofty or self-contemptuous as those with a manic episode. It might be that their commitments to family and career serve to limit their mania. Or, the anticipated shame and guilt associated with the failure and disappointment associated with a manic episode serve to retard manic energy.
   Unfortunately, there is little research to support these speculations. However, it may be that these are two very different disorders with very different origins. Clinical experience has shown that individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder who also display hypomanic symptoms are quite different from those with only depressive symptoms. For one, they are likely to have more episodes of severe depressive symptoms, more impaired functioning, and other mental disorders. But even more important, over time these


individuals are more likely to “convert” (meet the criteria) to bipolar I disorder.
   According to the DSM-5, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit one episode of major depression and at least one hypomanic episode. These individuals must never display a full manic episode nor any psychotic feature. For these individuals, the hypomania itself may not significantly contribute to problems in daily functioning. The more significant disruption emerges from the depressed symptoms. These symptoms must be significantly distressing and impair the individual’s ability to function in important areas of life. Furthermore, these episodes cannot have been caused by substance use or a medical condition or another mental disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of both variants of this disorder is not well understood. However, there is some evidence for genetic and physiological factors as causes or triggers for it (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Since this disorder runs in families, there appears to be a genetic basis for it. Major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymic disorder often occur together in families. This occurrence suggests that these mood disorders share similar causes. Levels of the neurotransmitter (brain chemical) called norepinephrine seem to influence bipolar symptoms. Low levels of norepinephrine are associated with depression, while high levels are associated with mania. Imbalanced hormones may be involved in causing or triggering bipolar disorder. An imbalance in hormones may be involved in causing or triggering bipolar disorder. For example, hormone changes related to childbirth may result in bipolar disorder. Environmental factors may also be involved. Stress, significant loss, abuse, or other traumatic experiences may play a role in the development of this disorder. Whether causative or not, stressful life events and alcohol or drug abuse can make the treatment of bipolar disorder more difficult.


Effective treatment usually involves psychotherapy and medication for both variants of this disorder.





However, in bipolar II, clinician will be more attentive to the depressed features rather than to the mania, which is a primary focus in the treatment of bipolar
I. Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), can be quite helpful in increasing emotional regulation. The challenge is to better manage daily life challenges. CBT helps those with this disorder in two ways. The first is to identify unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with more healthy and positive ones. The second is to identify triggers to both hypomanic and depressive episodes and better cope with upsetting situations. Medication may be helpful in emotional regulation. Medications like Lithium, Depakote, and Tegretol are particularly useful in regulating and stabilizing mood.
Birth Order

The term “birth order” refers to the rank or position of siblings by their age within a family unit.


• Middle child syndrome is a phenomenon commonly used to refer to the psychological and emotional results, usually negative, that


a person experiences when wedged between older and younger siblings (typically in a three-child family).
• Nature versus nurture refers to the ongoing debate among professionals as to which factors contribute more to differences in personality, intellect, and psychological development, biological/genetic (nature) or environmental/ social (nurture) contributors.
• Sibling rivalry refers to fighting, resentment, or feelings of animosity felt or displayed among brothers and sisters within a family.


Birth order defines the rank order of brothers and sisters by age within a family. For centuries, theorists and researchers have hypothesized about the impact birth order has on personality, IQ, self-esteem, and overall psychological development. While some evidence suggests that one’s position within one’s family of origin has a profound effect, there is also research to support the contrary. Factors including parenting style, gender, financial constraints, and health concerns can also influence family dynamics and increase the likelihood of sibling rivalry.
   Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler (1870–1937) was the first theorist to propose that birth order could be linked to commonalities among various personality types. Adler, himself a middle child, posited that one’s position within a family could have lasting effects on how one perceives situations and progresses through tasks related to work, family, and friends (Adler termed this “lifestyle”). Firstborn children are commonly viewed as reliable, structured, successful, competitive, high achieving, and conscientious. Those who are middle children are often described as flexible, even-tempered, people-pleasers, peacemakers, social, and sometimes rebellious. Lastborn children, also known as youngest children or babies, may be characterized as uncomplicated, fun-loving, pampered, attention seekers, manipulative, and outgoing. Finally, those who grow up as only children are described as mature, diligent, conscientious, leaders, and oftentimes perfectionists. Though these characteristics are





widely accepted, exceptions to these can and do exist. Likewise, variations in the traditional family structure can also result in distinctions, including situations that involve divorce, blended families, adoptions, and gap children (siblings who are separated by more than five years).


Research on birth order has been ongoing for decades, suggesting that this remains an area of interest to professionals in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, sociology, medicine, and education. Several of the studies, however, have lacked methodological rigor and adequate sample sizes. Findings, therefore, have been mixed, with some data pointing to the salience of familial rank while other results indicate that birth order does not necessarily leave an indelible mark on one’s personality or behavior as was once believed. Family size, which determines birth order, is associated with certain social factors, including ethnicity, education level, and socioeconomic status. Recent evidence has linked birth order and IQ with data reporting that the more older siblings a person has, the lower that person’s IQ is. Findings also indicate that birth order influences friendship and spousal choices with selections corresponding to similarities in personality. More rigorous studies are needed on this topic.



Blended families, commonly known as stepfamilies, describe familial structures consisting of children and parents who are not necessarily biologically related to one another.

• Nuclear family, or elementary family, defines a traditional family unit made up of a mother, a father, and their children.
• Stepfamily is another term used to describe a blended family, or a family unit consisting of parents and children who are not biologically related but formed as a result of parental separation, divorce, and possible remarriage.

Blended families, or stepfamilies, are prevalent in today’s society, and the traditional nuclear family can no longer be considered the norm. The term “blended” describes family units where the parents and children are not all biologically related but have formed after the ending of a previous relationship. Families that are blended include one or both of the parents whom have children with prior partners that join together through marriage, civil union, or simply by cohabiting. If the couple marries, the parent may be referred to as a “stepmother” or “stepfather” and siblings as “stepsister” or “stepbrother.” Stepparents, though they may assume some to all of the responsibilities associated with their new child, have no legal parental rights unless they legally adopt the child(ren). In the United States alone it is estimated that blended families make up approximately 40% of couples with children. Given that over 60% of all marriages now end in divorce, the number of blended families has increased substantially. Statistics further indicate that one-third of all marriages in the United States are remarriages.
Fortunately, a biological connection among family members is not necessary in order to form healthy, caring bonds. However, the transition process involved with blended families can be difficult. If the previous







relationship ended negatively, both adults and children may be suffering emotionally, which could place strain on the new unit. Divorce situations can cause angst, particularly if children still have hopes of parents reuniting. Custody disputes can add an additional level of stress. Adjusting to the new family structure, including roles and responsibilities, may take time. Often children resist discipline from their “new” parent, exhibiting overt misbehavior and disrespect. Others internalize pain and engage in destructive patterns that are harder to recognize and address.


Families today experience more transitions than families of the past. Frequent marriages, quicker divorces, and more short-term cohabiting relationships are

common for children and parents. Changes in living arrangements, parenting styles, and familial environments can have a profound impact on child/adolescent well-being. Difficulty accepting the new relationship and adjusting to different home expectations, rules, settings, and schedules can further complicate the process. Loss of familial stability can effect children socially, emotionally, and psychologically. Some may have a hard time maintaining healthy relationships, resulting from lack of trust and support. Research suggests that children from divorced families are at greater risk for delinquency; they display violent behaviors, use alcohol and drugs, and engage in sexual activity at higher rates than youngsters from intact families. Academic achievement also appears to be affected by family structure, with children from intact families performing better in school. Studies indicate that children





from broken homes are more prone to hyperactivity, mood swings, anxiety, and depression than their counterparts. However, experts agree that regardless of the familial structure most children thrive in households that are stable, consistent, and caring.




Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental disorder characterized by an excessive preoccupation with an imaginary or minor defect in a part of the body.


• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of counseling and psychotherapy that focuses on changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as CBT.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Muscle dysmorphia is the obsessive belief that one is not muscular enough.
• Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental disorder characterized by persistent thoughts and compulsive actions, such as cleaning, checking, counting, or hoarding.



Body dysmorphic disorder is one of the classes of obsessive and compulsive and related disorders in DSM-5. All of these disorders involve some kind of obsessive preoccupation and/or compulsion. Body dysmorphic disorder involves a persistent preoccupation with a part of the body—usually the face, skin, or hair—that is perceived as defective or problematic. Unfortunately for those diagnosed with this disorder, their perceived defect is not recognized by others. Repeated attempts to reduce or eliminate the disorder fail. They also mentally compare their personal appearance to that of others. The extent of the individual’s preoccupation causes significant distress or impairment in occupational, social, and other areas of life. There are gender differences in how this disorder presents. Males with it tend to be preoccupied with either genital or muscle dysmorphia. In contrast, females tend to be preoccupied with a wide range of appearance-based concerns.
Typically, those diagnosed with this disorder are
ashamed of how they look and embarrassed about the amount of focus that they must put on their appearance. They are convinced that others perceive them as they do themselves and also believe that others are mocking them for these perceived defects. Because of the shame they experience and the belief that others notice their perceived defects, they tend to introverted, quiet, and reserved. They seldom have close, intimate friendships because of their shame, low self-esteem, and related social anxiety. They also may incorrectly and negatively interpret the facial expressions of others, especially in situations where the social cues are vague.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a pattern of fixation and concern about perceived imperfections and flaws in their physical appearance even though these defects go unrecognized or seem minor to others. Some individuals are specifically concerned with having a deficient body build or muscle mass. They also have developed and engaged in repeated patterns in response to their concerns about their appearance.





Such repeated behaviors might include mirror checking, extreme and unnecessary grooming, exercising, or picking at their skin. In addition, individuals will engage in approval-seeking behaviors about their appearance from others. Mental acts of comparing personal appearance to that of others are common. These repeated behavioral and mental acts cause enough distress to impact social, occupational, and other areas of functioning. Preoccupation with appearance cannot be related or attributed to concerns about weight or body fat in persons who have been diagnosed with an eating disorder. Persons with body dysmorphic disorder may differ in their level of insight. In addition, those diagnosed with this disorder may have problems with executive functioning and visual processing (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is not fully understood. However, it may be genetic in origin and tends to run in families where obsessive-compulsive disorder is diagnosed. It is often associated with childhood abuse and neglect. Individuals may have grown up with limited opportunities to deal with life’s demands and may have never “fit in” within the family, the school, or other social settings. As children, they may have developed repetitive patterns of evasion in response to their parent’s expectations. Psychologically, individuals are likely to value perfection and believe that appearances are important. They tend to view themselves as defective and unique but unable to be acceptable to others. They tend to view the world as unsafe and that others find them disgusting. Low self-esteem, few social connections, and limited personal responsibility are likely to have predisposed them to be self-absorbed and focused on appearance.


The clinical treatment of this disorder is a combination of medications and counseling or psychotherapy. Those with this disorder respond reasonably well to antidepressant medications such as Prozac, Luvox, and Paxil. They tend to require higher dosages of these medications than those who are being treated for depression with these drugs. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective approach to psychotherapy with these individuals. Because the disorder involves


inaccurate self-perceptions and beliefs about their appearance, the focus of CBT is to challenge these beliefs. Because of their perfectionism, those who seek cosmetic plastic surgery typically end up feeling the same or worse. For this reason, many plastic surgeons routinely refer those who seek cosmetic surgery for a psychological evaluation prior to surgery.




The term “body image” is often considered to be the way an individual views his or her body. However, body image also includes how a person thinks and feels about his or her body. Body image is influenced by how a person takes care of his or her body, the absence or presence of medical issues, and reactions from others. Negative thoughts about one’s body image can lead to serious challenges, many of which are more common among women, including psychological distress, shame, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and even eating disorders.

Body image is a complex psychological concept that includes a subjective picture of one’s own physical appearance that comes both from self-observation and from the reactions of others.
   Body image can be negative when compared to unrealistic models for both men (muscular) and women





(thin). However, women tend to experience body dissatisfaction more often than men. Body image is influenced from birth. Individuals develop their body image through a combination of their own thoughts and ideas, as well as feedback from their family, friends, culture, and society. While many may not be happy with their body image, there are some who are so unhappy that it may become a component to developing an eating disorder or lead to other mental health challenges, such as anxiety or depression.
   Body image is a mental picture that individuals have when they think of what they look like not only to themselves but also to others. However, these thoughts are merely perceptions and may be extremely accurate on one end of the spectrum or completely inaccurate on the other end.
   Body image is an important psychological concept because distorted self-views are widespread among American women and those self-views influence an individual’s behavior. It is important to note that men are affected by negative body image as well, but it is more readily discussed and recognized in women. Some have taken the position that body image often has a negative connotation to it. There has been an idealized perception of body image that women maintain a thin frame and men have a muscular frame.
   Those suffering from a negative body image tend to either avoid their thoughts and emotions regarding their image or take steps toward improving their perceived flaws. At times, this approach can lead to lower self-esteem or disordered eating.
   Children and adolescents who report having positive family relationships tend to have higher body image satisfaction. Children and adolescents who sense their parents have negative thoughts about their body image can often hold negative self-views of their bodies. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia, have been on the rise since the 1950s. One of the key diagnostic factors is associated with having a negative poor body image, which causes great mental distress. Those working in the field have been calling for the focus to be on wellness and not on weight.
   Body image is a constant topic of discussion everywhere from news programs to media. Society especially focuses on the body image of celebrities and is quick to scrutinize when an A-lister gains weight, even


during pregnancy. For example, when pop singing sensation Christina Aguilera gained weight and moved from being a tiny starlet to a curvaceous figure, the media and public were quick to criticize her harshly. However, Christina took the platform to encourage people to love their bodies regardless of shape or size. Dove is a soap company that has been working hard to focus on real beauty and looks to improve women’s body image. In its 2013 advertising campaign, the company hired an FBI sketch artist to draw seven women as they described themselves. The artist was not able to see the women and was only able to ask questions having them describe their appearance. Then, strangers were asked to describe these same women to the artist. In each of the sketches, the ones that came from the women’s self-descriptions were far less attractive than those that came from a stranger’s description. The message was clear for everyone that women are often critical of their appearance and the goal should be to love and find beauty in themselves.






• Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental disorder characterized by an excessive preoccupation with an imaginary or minor defect in a part of the body.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Gender identity disorder is a mental disorder characterized by significant dysphoria (discontent) with one’s biological sex or the gender roles associated with that sex. It is also called gender dysphoria.
• Proprioception is the body’s internal sense of its position in space and of the location of body parts in relation to one another.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.


Body integrity identity disorder is a mental disorder characterized by an intense desire, in a nonpsychotic individual, to have one or more body parts (usually limbs) removed by amputation. Usually, body part is healthy, functioning, and not deformed. Individuals with this disorder typically have an idealistic image or view of themselves as amputees and desire to have their body altered to conform to that image. They strongly believe that the body part is foreign or unwanted and will “feel complete” only when it is removed. They may use assistive devices (like crutches) in public in order to appear disabled. Almost always, they feel ashamed, embarrassed, or depressed.
   The disorder was proposed for inclusion in DSM-5. But, because it is such a rare condition with very little research, it was not included as a separate disorder. However, it was considered as a possible subtype of body dysmorphic disorder. After serious review,


researchers noted a basic difference between the two disorders. Those with body dysmorphic disorder are excessively concerned about perceived defects in one or more features of their body and want to improve that feature. In contrast, those with body integrity identity disorder want to amputate the defective feature. Actually, this disorder is more similar to gender identity disorder in that the individual believes that a body part is alien to his or her sense of self, similar to the way in which a person with gender identity disorder believes that biological sex is alien to his or her sense of self.
   The cause of the disorder is as of yet unknown. It may be that there is damage to the brain involving proprioception. As a result, individuals with this disorder have brains that fail to “recognize” the body parts that they want amputated. Another explanation is that this disorder may be an extension of body alteration methods that are so common today. These include body piercing, breast implants, and other plastic surgery alterations for aesthetic purposes.


There is no definitive treatment for this disorder. For some individuals, surgical removal of the body part has been beneficial. However, because such surgery poses significant ethical concerns, it is not the treatment of choice. For others, psychotherapy may be helpful to deal more effectively with other problems in their lives.


Acts of body piercing and tattooing are the two most common forms of what is known as body modification or body adornment. Although the history of body piercing dates back centuries, today’s body piercing often has very different meanings and motivations. In fact, one’s self-identity, a desire for beauty, and distinction from others are often the reasons cited for body piercing. However, there have been several studies that show individuals who engage in body piercing have higher incidence rates of sexual abuse, physical injury, and criminal history.
   In addition, the body modification population shows tendencies for addictive behavior and often uses the piercings as a way to cope with trauma. Other studies have shown body piercings and tattoos to be strongly related to anger, substance abuse, eating disorders in adolescents, early sexual activity, and self-injury.
   Body piercing has become increasingly more widespread in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe over the past 20 years. It falls under the category of body modification. This includes procedures that permanently alter a person’s body, usually by puncturing the skin to insert a piece of jewelry. Body piercing and tattooing are the two most common forms of body modifications and are practiced by approximately 6.5% and 8.5% of the population, respectively. Piercings are commonly placed in the upper ear, nose, navel, lip, tongue, cheek, and uvula, and are most common among adolescents and young adults.
   In history, body piercing was considered a form of cultural expression among a number of civilizations. It has been used to express religious, sexual, and cultural identities. Evidence shows that the Aztecs practiced ear piercing 4,000 years ago. Piercing of the nose has been common among Alaskan natives since the 19th century, tongue piercing was common among Mayan Indians, and genital piercing is mentioned in the Kama Sutra, which maintains evidence of penis piercings that included attaching jewelry.
   Body piercing became increasingly common during the punk rock movement that began in the late 1970s in Europe. A counterculture was born in an effort to shock and provoke. This practice soon took root in the homosexual and sadomasochist population in


the United States and Britain. Shortly thereafter, top music and film celebrities embraced body piercing. Emerging trends in body piercing also include brandings, which is scarring the body by applying heated materials to the skin.
   Other forms of body piercing include cuttings, which are cuts in the skin using a sharp knife or blade, as well as implantations of three-dimensional objects placed under the skin to create a sculpture on the surface of the skin. Another form of body piercing is known as pocketing, which is a stapling of the flesh. Stretching or gauging is one form of piercing that is growing in popularity. It involves gradually expanding the ear lobe or any other part of the ear.
   Significant medical risks are associated with body piercings. The risks vary in severity from infection and nerve damage to sterility and even death. The most common side effects are bleeding and bacterial and viral infections (e.g., viral hepatitis and HIV), as well as tissue damage and allergies.
   Some social scientists believe that individuals who modify their bodies are motivated by rebellion and defiance. They believe that modifications of gauging, piercing, cutting, pocketing, tattoos, and so on, are a way of demonstrating their rejection of conformity to social standards and conventionality.






Knowing the connection between mind and body, physiotherapists and other body work practitioners have developed physical treatments known as body work therapies to help reengage the mind’s control over the body and heal or prevent other injuries to the body. A healthy mind has dominion over the body. Likewise, a person with an unhealthy mind or other injuries can lose control over his or her body.


• Body work therapy is a general term that refers to all physical and psychotherapy treatments involving movement or touch to heal the body. These body-based therapies are often designed to unite the body and the mind or heal other injuries in the body.


Often classified as alternative medicine, body work can involve physical techniques, manipulative therapies, massage, and breath work. One goal of this type of therapy is to increase a person’s awareness of his or her own body. This therapy can be used to improve posture, heal ongoing stress injuries (as in athletes or dancers), realign the body’s structure, increase a person’s movement, and even overcome emotional traumas like post-traumatic stress disorder. These body work therapies can take many forms. At times, it can involve deep-tissue work, while the patient lies in a passive state. At times, it can involve applying pressure on hypersensitive spots on the patient’s body. At times, it can involve practicing Tai-Chi Chuan (Tai Chi) or other Zen relaxation techniques. At times, it can even involve talk therapy in conjunction with physical treatments.
   Since each person is unique, body work therapies focus on addressing the individual. Body work practitioners stress the importance of empathy and intuition when working with new patients to address their specific needs. Examples of popular body work therapies include basic body awareness therapy (BBAT), the Alexander Technique, acupressure, Hellerwork, Shiatsu, Trigger Point Therapy, and Rolfing.


   There are a few minor risks involved with body work therapy. For instance, anyone who has recently undergone surgery or suffered a serious injury should not begin body work therapy without first consulting his or her physician. Patients suffering from serious illnesses or infections should wait to start body work therapy. If patients are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, body work can trigger violent reactions, flashbacks, anxiety attacks, and feelings of rage. Also, some body work like Rolfing or Hellerwork can cause mild discomfort for new patients.

Interestingly, various forms of body work therapy have existed for centuries. One of the oldest forms of body work is Shiatsu, which was discovered in the early 20th century in Japan. However, Shiatsu evolved from an ancient form of Japanese massage that was practiced for centuries known as “Anma.” Throughout the 20th and now 21st centuries, new body work practitioners, massage therapists, and physiotherapists have continued to develop new forms of body work therapies to treat all kinds of physical injuries, chronic pain, and emotional trauma. One of the most recent developments has been in using body work to treat mental illness. Scandinavian health services now regularly use a treatment known as BBAT to treat schizophrenia patients. Through various therapy sessions of movement, massage, Tai-Chi, and breathing, schizophrenic patients are often able to overcome or reduce the physical symptoms of schizophrenia like disembodiment, lack of mental awareness, loss of balance, loss of erect posture, or other bodily functions. After this therapy, schizophrenic patients also tended to have higher self-esteem, less anxiety, and an overall feeling that they have more ownership over their bodies.
The body–mind connection is extremely important
in this type of therapy. Shiatsu specialists often work with post-traumatic stress disorder victims—including children—to help them overcome their recent emotional traumas. Specifically, Shiatsu has been known to help soldiers who have just returned from combat, children or other individuals who grew up in war zones, trauma victims with missing limbs, abuse victims who suffered from mental or physical abuse, and





those who recently experienced a death of a loved one. Body work therapy continues to thrive as a recognized medical practice in both Eastern and Western medicine.


Borderline personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, affects, self-harm, and a high degree of impulsivity.


• Brief psychotic episode is a period in which an individual experiences psychotic symptoms such as hearing voices (hallucinations), paranoid thoughts, depersonalization (feeling unreal), or disorganized speech. The episode is usually triggered by substances, medications, or extreme stress.
• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Dialectical behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on coping with stress, regulating emotions, and improving relationships.


• External locus of control is the belief that one’s life is controlled by forces outside the individual’s control.
• Idealizing is the exaggeration of positive qualities and the minimization of negative qualities.
• Mindfulness is the moment-by-moment awareness of one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, and environment without evaluating or judging them.
• Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behavior, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Splitting is the inability to synthesize (put together) contradictory qualities, such that the individual views others as either all good or all bad.

Borderline personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by a pattern of unpredictability, impulsivity, troubled relationships, anger, mood swings, and self-destructive behavior. Individuals with borderline personalities present with a complex clinical picture, including diverse combinations of anger, anxiety, intense and labile affect, and brief disturbances of consciousness such as depersonalization and dissociation. In addition, their presentation includes chronic loneliness, a sense of emptiness, boredom, volatile interpersonal relations, identity confusion, and impulsive behavior that can include self-injury or self-mutilation. Stress can even precipitate a psychotic episode. Of all the personality disorders, they are more likely to have irregularities of circadian rhythms (physiological cycles), especially of the sleep–wake cycle. As a result, chronic insomnia is a common complaint.
   The borderline personality in individuals is identified by the following: behavior style, interpersonal style, thinking style, and feeling style. Their behavioral style is characterized by physically self-damaging





acts such as suicide gestures, self-mutilation, or the provocation of fights. They tend to accomplish less in their careers and socially than their intelligence and talents would suggest. Their interpersonal style tends to fluctuate quickly between idealizing and clinging to another individual to devaluing and opposing that individual. They are overly sensitive to rejection and abandonment feelings following even slight stressors. Their relationships tend to develop rather quickly and intensely. They are typically intolerant of being alone. As a result they seek out the company of others in indiscriminate sexual affairs, late-night phone calls, or after-hours emergency room visits with vague medical or psychiatric complaints. Their thinking style is best described as inflexible and impulsive. They reason by analogy from past experiences and have difficulty reasoning logically and learning from past mistakes. Because they have an external locus of control, borderlines usually blame others when things go wrong. By accepting responsibility for their own failings, borderlines believe they would feel even more powerless to change circumstances. They often have difficulty recalling images and feeling states which could make sense of their situation and soothe them in times of turmoil. Their inflexibility and impulsivity are further noted in their tendency toward splitting and an inability to tolerate frustration. Finally, because of difficulty in focusing attention and subsequent loss of relevant data, borderlines also have a diminished capacity to process information. Finally, their feeling style is characterized by marked mood shifts from a normal mood to a depressed mood. In addition, inappropriate and intense anger and rage may easily be triggered. Other feelings can include emptiness, a deep “void,” or boredom.
The cause of this disorder is not well understood.
However, these individuals tend to have characteristic view of themselves, the world, and others and a basic life strategy. They tend to view themselves defective and needy. They tend to view their world as unpredictable and hurtful. Accordingly, their basic life strategy and pattern is to expect others to take care of them and make them happy. They will not likely commit to anything and will reverse roles and vacillate in their thinking and feelings when under actual or perceived attack. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals


can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a pervasive pattern of unstable relationships, emotional reactions, identity, and impulsivity. They engage in frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, whether it is real or imagined. Their interpersonal relationships are intense, unstable, and alternate between the extremes of idealization and devaluation. They have chronic identity issues and an unstable sense of self. Their impulsivity can result in self-damaging actions such as reckless driving or drug use, binge eating, or high-risk sex. These individuals engage in recurrent suicidal threats, gestures, acting out, or self-mutilating behavior. They can exhibit markedly reactive moods, chronic feelings of emptiness, emotional outbursts, and difficulty controlling their anger. They may also experience brief, stress-related paranoid thinking or brief psychotic episodes (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).


The clinical treatment of this disorder typically involves psychotherapy and may include medication. Decisions about treatment goals and focus are best based on an assessment of the individuals for overall level of functioning. Higher-functioning borderlines have a greater probability for collaborating in psychotherapeutic treatment than the lower-functioning borderlines. Higher-functioning individuals with this disorder may be responsive to traditional psychotherapy that is focused on insight and solving problems of daily living. With lower-functioning individuals, treatment goals may be more limited. The focus of treatment is more likely to be on managing crises and achieving and maintaining more stable functioning. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is one of the most effective treatment approaches with borderlines, particular with lower-functioning individuals. DBT incorporates four treatment components: individual therapy, skills training in a group, telephone contact, and therapist consultation. The rationale for the group component is that the intense interpersonal relationship that forms between the therapist and the client serves as the trigger for the client acting-out. Such acting-out is effectively reduced in a group format. Just as important, skills like emotion regulation and mindfulness are learned





in this treatment format. Medication can also be used with this disorder. It is aimed at target symptoms such as impulsivity, insomnia, depression, or anxiety. Such medications include antidepressants, antianxiety, and antipsychotic drugs.



Bowen family systems theory was developed in the 1950s by Dr. Murray Bowen (1913–1990), a psychiatrist and professor who is considered a pioneer in family therapy. The foundation of his systems theory is the belief that a family is best understood as an interconnected emotional unit and thus any therapeutic intervention needs to address the complex interactions among various family members in the context of the entire family system.
   This approach to family counseling is strongly grounded in theory and has provided a majority of the mainstream language utilized when exploring and discussing family systems and family therapy. Bowen introduced the majority of mainstream language in


regard to family systems therapy, including ordinal birth position, genograms, and differentiation of self.
   Murray Bowen was born in 1913 and was the oldest of five children. He earned his MD from the University of Tennessee Medical School in 1937 and interned at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. His psychiatric training began in 1946 in Kansas. Bowen was also part of a five-year research project through the National Institutes of Mental Health. His research focused on parents and family members of schizophrenic children who had been hospitalized for extended periods of time.
   Bowen believed that his efficacy as a therapist was directly linked to his understanding of natural systems theory, something he used as a guide for working with both families and individual patients. He held strongly to the science of human behavior, asserting that there was a difference between what a person was and what he or she felt, imagined, or said. Although there were critics, many agree that family systems theory is among the most fully developed, theoretically grounded views of the family.
   Bowen also adopted the idea of family constellation to look at sibling position. This looks at the fixed and ordinal birth positions. Bowen believed that using the ordinal approach he could identify the role the children would play in the emotional aspect of the family life.
   In order to help assess these patterns, Bowen was the first therapist to use a genogram. This tool provides a map or diagram of multiple generations and the relationships among the members. This allows for a way of organizing the important information about the family expanding at least three generations. This tool allows for understanding from both the therapist and the family members who now have a visualization of their relationships and patterns. The genogram includes names of family members and dates of birth, marriage, divorce, and death as well as cultural and ethnic origins, religious affiliation, socioeconomic status, and type of relationships.
   Bowen also utilized process questions to encourage clients to consider the roles they play in relating with members of their family. He encouraged participants to speak directly to him as opposed to each other during the session. The questions were circular as the focus of change is in relation to others who are viewed





as having an effect on functioning. Bowen also encouraged the use of I-positions, which are clear statements of personal opinion and belief that do not have emotional connections. This allows for members to communicate in a more rational manner.
   Bowen therapists are concerned with changing individuals within the context of a system. Problems are viewed as stemming from relationship patterns in the family of origin. Therefore, the family of origin must be understood and patterns and relationships addressed.
   Bowen therapists are central contributors to the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy as well as to several current key academic journals such as The Journal of Marital and Family Therapy. This theory is actively taught and explored in graduate programs to future clinicians. Bowen’s concept of a genogram has been adapted by several other theorists and actively used by many in the family therapy field.


 




The brain is the organ at the center of the nervous system that controls all other organs and bodily functions.


• Autonomic means involuntary or unconscious.
• Central nervous system is one of the two parts of the nervous system that contains the brain and the spinal cord.
• Genes are deoxyribonucleic acid or blueprints that create molecules called proteins. Genes determine heredity.
• Glial cells are cells in the central nervous system that provide support for surrounding neurons. Glial cells do not send electrical signals.
• Homoeostasis is the tendency of a system to regulate internal processes and maintain a stable and constant condition.
• Magnetic resonance imaging is a medical diagnostic test that uses magnetic fields to produce detailed images of the brain and internal organs. It is also referred to as MRI.
• Nervous system is the body’s control system that is responsible for all voluntary and





involuntary actions. It regulates chemical processes and responds to internal and external stimuli. It is made up of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.
• Neurons are brain cells that process and send information throughout the body via electrical signals.
• Neurotransmitters are chemicals in the brain that send messages across synapses from one neuron to another neuron.
• Peripheral nervous system is one of the two parts of the nervous system that connects the central nervous system to the organs, muscles, blood vessels, and glands.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapy and therapeutic counseling.


The brain is the three-pound organ that controls everything an individual or animal does. It controls all conscious and unconscious processes. It initiates muscle activity and releases chemicals that allow a person or animal to quickly respond to environmental stimuli. In combination with the spinal cord and surrounding nerves, it makes up the central nervous system. The brain is considered in terms of two hemispheres. The right hemisphere is associated with abstract and creative functions and is responsible for induction, or reasoning from specific to general. The left hemisphere is associated with linear and rational functions and is responsible for deduction, or reasoning from general to specific. The brain is composed of three parts: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain. The forebrain regulates sensory and information processing, instinctual functions, and voluntary functions. The midbrain regulates vision, hearing, motor control, temperature, sleep, and arousal. The hindbrain is the stem that connects the brain to the spinal cord. It regulates autonomic functions such as heart rate and breathing. It also helps maintain balance, provide movement coordination, and manage sensory information. One of the


most important functions of the brain is homeostasis or the regulation of internal chemical processes to maintain a constant balance. The hypothalamus, located at the bottom of the forebrain, is primarily responsible for basic biological functions and homeostasis.
   The brain regulates an individual’s basic survival instincts and is the motivator that activates behavior to seek food, water, and shelter. It works on a reward-punishment system. When a behavior results in a positive consequence, the reward system produces chemical changes in the brain that cause that behavior to be repeated in similar situations. In contrast, when a behavior results in a negative consequence, the punishment system produces chemical changes in the brain that cause that behavior to be repressed or extinguished. The reward mechanism in the brain plays a significant role in drug and alcohol addiction.
   The brain makes it possible for humans and other animals to learn from experiences and modify their behavior. In turn, modified behavior influences brain processes. Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852–1934), a Spanish neuroscientist, claimed that when learning occurs, there are chemical changes that take place between neurons in the brain. It wasn’t until 1971 that physical evidence was found by Terje Lomo (1930–) to support Cajal’s claims.
   The brain an individual is born with contains the majority of cells it will ever have. What determines brain growth after birth is how much or how little the connections between the brain cells develop. Genes produce proteins that work to connect brain cells. Although the genetics of a brain cannot be altered, the biochemical process within these proteins can. The brain contains two primary groups of cells, neurons and glial cells, which transmit signals to communicate between cells. The points of communication are called synapses. Neurotransmitters are released at synapses. Neurons work together to form a circuit. Circuits work together to form specialized brain systems. Different brain systems regulate functions such as language, perception, or decision making. Environmental influences have the capacity to activate or deactivate the chemical process between cells and impact brain development. Scientific research has shown that growth and development of the brain depends on both genes and experiences.





   The debate on the relationship between the brain and mind was started by Rene Descartes (1596–1650) when he made the statement, “I think, therefore I am.” The neural activity in the brain is necessary for language, cognitions, emotions, and overall existence of the mind. Researchers indicate that the mind is a complex function of the brain and when the brain is impaired, so is the mind. Similarly, problems with the mind (mental illness) can impair the brain’s functioning. For example, depressive illnesses are disorders of the brain. Research studies using magnetic resonance imaging have shown that brains of depressed individuals appear different from individuals without depression. The brain functions that regulate mood, thoughts, behavior, the sleep–wake cycle, and appetite are affected by changes in serotonin levels. Antidepressant medication boosts neurotransmitter levels and assists in restoring homeostasis (balance). Medication in combination with psychotherapy usually results in the better outcome for many depressed individuals.




Brain imaging is a set of medical diagnostic techniques for directly or indirectly imaging the structure and function of the brain. It is also known as neuroimaging.


• Brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM) is a quantitative version of the electroencephalogram (EEG) test, which produces a colored schematic map of the head.


• Computed tomography (CT) is a medical diagnostic test in which computer-processed X-rays produce tomographs (cross-sectional images) of body areas.
• Electroencephalography is a medical diagnostic test that records electrical activity on the scalp to evaluate various brain functions and psychological disorders.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic imaging device that uses electromagnetic radiation and a strong magnetic field to produce images of soft tissues.
• Positron emission tomography (PET) is a diagnostic imaging technique that uses radioactive substances to produce three-dimensional colored images within the body.
• Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a diagnostic imaging device that uses gamma rays to produces images of the body.


Brain imaging is a set of medical diagnostic techniques that are useful in providing images (pictures) of the brain used in detecting injury or disease. These images directly or indirectly identify the brain structures and functioning. There are six common types of brain imaging techniques currently in use. They are the EEG, computerized axial tomography (CT), the single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and its related functional MRI scan (fMRI).
   The first actual neuroimaging technique was the EEG. It was the first effort to measure brain physiology. By taping tiny metal electrodes on the top and sides of a patient’s head, the EEG measures neuron-generated evoked potentials (electrical currents) on the surface of the brain. These EEG-generated potentials are valuable in that they measure the functionality of sensory and neuromuscular pathways. Thus, this type of neuroimaging is most commonly used to diagnose epilepsy and sleep disorders. A quantitative version of the EEG,







called brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM), produces a brain map with electrical potentials identified with colors. This brain map is particularly useful in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and mild closed-head injuries.
   Computerized axial tomography scan (CT scan) involves X-rays that move in a small circular arc and penetrate the patient’s head. The different intensities of the X-rays measure the location of and variant density of brain tissue and are used by a computer to construct a composite picture of the brain. This type of neuroimaging can be used to identify blockages, clots, and bleeding in the brain. These pathological changes are visually represented on a computer screen. While the CT is effective in displaying brain anatomy, it cannot measure brain functioning. However, the SPECT is an extension of CT scanning that can assess functioning.

SPECT uses radioactive materials injected through a vein to generate high-resolution images. The SPECT scanner monitors the tracer’s movement through body tissues. The rate of its radioactive decay allows the clinician to obtain three-dimensional images of blood flow in the heart or electrical activity in different areas of the brain. It can also scan for tumors or bone disease.
   Positron emission tomography was the first neuroimaging device to create three-dimensional localization of brain function. PET requires patients to ingest (drink) or be injected with a radioactive substance. This substance emits positrons from which a computer image is generated as with CT scans. Tumors, lesions, and psychiatric abnormalities are visualized. In psychiatric conditions, PRT can identify metabolic activity in the brain. Low levels suggest conditions like





depression, while high levels suggest conditions such as schizophrenia.
   Magnetic resonance imaging scan is the most popular type of neuroimaging. Because it uses magnetic fields rather than X-rays, it is safer than a CT scan. By placing electromagnets around a patient’s head, the MRI works by generating a visual representation of the brain’s functioning. MRI is used to identify tumors, tissue degeneration, and blood clots. Like the CT scan, MRI scan provide only anatomical but not physiological information. However, the fMRI scan can provide such physiological or functional information. It is able to measure rapidly changing physiology and generate three-dimensional images of the

brain. More specifically, it can measure blood and		
oxygen flow.



Starting in 1850, clinicians and researchers used invasive techniques to examine the brain. Cutting open a living patient’s skull to identify specific brain anatomy and functioning was the only available technique in the pre-neuroimaging era. The obvious advantage of all the neuroimaging techniques that were to emerge in the 20th century was that clinicians and researchers had a noninvasive view of the brain’s anatomy and physiology while the patient remained conscious. In the 1920s the ventricles (cavities or open spaces) of the brain and spinal cord were first visualized with X-rays, as were normal and abnormal blood vessels in and around the brain. It was in the early 1970s that CT scanning became available for diagnostic and research purposes. In the early 1980s, SPECT and PET of the brain were introduced. In the late 1980s, the BEAM emerged. It was derived from the EEG. Except for the CT scan, these other imagining techniques were primarily used for research purposes. About the same time, MRI was developed. About 1990 fMRI became available. However, it was not until the early 2000s that brain imaging for clinical purposes became feasible.

The Breakfast Club (1985) was the second successful movie by writer and director John Hughes about the important, coming-of-age issues that face most teens in high school. The film is known for its accurate and believable dialogue and its realistic depiction of the problems that teenagers face.


In this film, five teenagers are alienated not only from the adult world of their parents and teachers but also from each other because they come from different cliques or social groups in the school which makes them feel like they have nothing in common. All that ends on a long Saturday when the five end up being forced to spend an all-day detention together. The group starts with only a vague knowledge of one another which leads them to rely on stereotypes (classifications of other people by overly simplified conceptions, opinions, or images). Gradually, however, as the day wears on, the five t students open up to one another. The characters include John Bender, acted by Judd Nelson, who plays the “criminal”; Andrew Clark, played by Emilio Estevez, who is the “athlete”; Brian Johnson, played by Anthony Michael Hall, the “brain”; Allison Reynolds, played by Ally Sheedy, who is the “basket case”; and Claire Standish, played by Molly Ringwald, who is the “princess.”
These five must remain together in the high school
library for a period of 8 hours and 54 minutes: from






Although released thirty years ago, The Breakfast Club (1985), a film by writer director John Hughes, still speaks to teenagers today.The movie shows teenagers who are alienated not only from the adult world of parents and teachers but also from each other because they come from different school cliques or social groups, making them feel that they have nothing in common. Left to right are Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson (top), Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez, and front, Molly Ringwald. (Universal Pictures/Photofest)


exactly 7:06 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. They are instructed to write a 1000-word essay, in which each student must write about who he or she thinks he or she is. Bender, who rejects authority, disregards the assignment and stirs up the other students.
   The students spend the day fighting, talking, smoking marijuana, and dancing. Gradually they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets. They all discover that they have strained relationships with their parents and are afraid of making the same mistakes as the adults around them. As they grow more involved, they begin to fear that once detention is over they will return to their cliques and never speak to each other again.


   Toward the end of the day, the other students ask Brian “the brain” to write the essay assigned earlier. But instead of writing about the given topic, Brian writes a letter objecting to the topic, stating that they have already been judged and labeled. Brian signs the essay on behalf of the group, “The Breakfast Club.”
   The theme that resonated with audiences was the sense of alienation not only from authority figures but between each of them as stereotyped teens. It is only when they realize how alike their struggles are, especially with their parents, that they become close. They discover that they are more alike than they are different.

Impact (Psychological Influence)
Similar to Hughes’s earlier film Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club spoke to teenage problems and angst by taking its characters and their struggles seriously. It also directly addressed the cliques and stereotyping that is often typical of the teenage years, especially during high school. One of the main reasons why this film remains so influential and popular is its authenticity in portraying teenage issues, many of which transcend the time period of the movie.




Brief dynamic psychotherapy is a psychological treatment approach that focuses on maladaptive interpersonal patterns that are treated by facilitating new experiences.




• Attachment is the emotional bond between children and caregivers that can provide a secure (healthy) base from which children are able to safely explore their environment and relate to others.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Corrective emotional experience is a treatment strategy in which a therapist provides a more supportive and new relational response as compared to the assumed expectations of the client.
• Countertransference is the unconscious redirection of feelings from the therapist to the client.
• Cyclic maladaptive pattern is the pattern (manner) in which a person relates to others and how it influences all aspects of an individual’s life.
• Insight is the awareness that occurs when an individual attains a fuller understanding of self and others.
• Interpretation is a guess or hypothesis made by a therapist about the relationship between an individual’s behaviors, thoughts, or emotions and his or her unconscious emotions or thoughts.
• Psychoanalytic theory is a psychological theory that explains behaviors and perceptions as the result of unconscious, sexual, and biological instincts. It was originally developed by Sigmund Freud.
• Psychodynamic therapy is a form of psychotherapy that emphasizes unconscious (outside awareness) conflicts and focuses on an individual’s early childhood and dreams.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapy and therapeutic counseling.


• Transference is the unconscious redirection of feelings from the client to the therapist.


Brief dynamic psychotherapy is a shortened form of psychodynamic therapy. The roots of this approach are in Sigmund Freud’s (1856–1939) psychoanalytic theory. The healing process that occurs in long-term psychoanalytic therapy typically requires years of therapy, while brief dynamic therapy can occur in a relatively short amount of time. Given the emphasis on cost savings in health care today, individuals are often eligible for only a limited amount of therapy sessions. Psychologist Hans H. Strupp (1921–2006) developed such a time-limited approach which he called brief dynamic psychotherapy. This approach can effect change in a relatively few sessions, usually 20 or less. Of the several brief approaches to psychotherapy used in clinical practice today, time-limited dynamic psychotherapy is a commonly used and research-based approach.
   The goal in brief dynamic therapy is to provide individuals with new experiences of themselves and others through corrective emotional experiences provided in session. Other brief dynamic therapy strategies include interpretation, resolving transference, and fostering insight. Further, therapists aim to assist clients in understanding themselves and developing insight into their relationships by exploring unmet needs that are associated with early attachment figures. The brief dynamic therapy model assumes that individuals’ maladaptive interpersonal patterns are reenacted in therapy, and the practitioner will be influenced by the client’s dynamics. The therapist’s countertransference toward the client also provides information about the client’s cyclical maladaptive pattern. Countertransference and transference issues are used in this approach to modify preexisting relational, emotional, and behavioral patterns through in-session processing of these dynamics.
   Human suffering, such as depression, is conceptualized from this perspective by examining faulty relationship patterns with caregivers, and these faulty patterns are commonly reflected in presenting symptoms and interpersonal distress. The client’s cyclical maladaptive pattern is at the heart of conceptualizing an individual’s presenting issues. The four relational components to





assess are acts of self, expectations of others reactions, acts of others toward the self, and acts of the self toward the self. Acts of self include thoughts, feelings, wishes, motives, perceptions, and behaviors of the client. Expectations of others reactions include how the clients imagine others will react to them in response to their actions. Acts of others toward the self are the actual behaviors of others, as observed or perceived by the client. Finally, acts of the self toward the self are the clients’ behaviors toward themselves and also their relationship with themselves.
Developments and Current Status
While Sigmund Freud’s psychodynamic theories are a primary influence, more recent proponents of brief dynamic psychotherapy include Jeffrey L. Binder (1943–) and Hanna Levenson (1945–), who prefer the designation brief dynamic therapy. Both were mentored by Hans Strupp. A relatively small number of professional therapists exclusively use psychodynamic therapy in practice today. However, more therapists use elements of psychodynamic therapy to conceptualize their cases but implement cognitive behavior therapy techniques to treat their clients.




Brief psychotic disorder is a mental disorder characterized by psychotic symptoms with a sudden onset, short duration, and the full return of functioning. It is usually triggered by extreme stress. This disorder is also referred to as acute, transient, or reactive psychotic disorder.


• Antipsychotic medication drugs are prescribed drugs that are intended to reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also known as neuroleptics.
• Catatonia is disorganized, limited, or complete absence of normal physical behavior.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.
• Delusions are fixed false beliefs that persist despite contrary evidence.
• Family therapy is a type of psychotherapy for families that focuses on improving relationships and understanding between family members.
• Hallucinations are false or distorted sensory perceptions that appear to be real perceptions that are generated by the mind rather than by an external stimuli.
• Psychotic symptoms are a group of severe symptoms that include hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, or disorganized movement.
• Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by psychotic features. These disorders include schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder.
• Substance-induced psychotic disorder is a mental disorder characterized by hallucinations or delusions caused by the use of or withdrawal from substance like alcohol or cocaine.

Brief psychotic disorder is one of the schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Individuals with this disorder are likely to present with acute psychotic symptoms that have appeared suddenly. It almost always follows an extreme stressor. Emergency hospitalization is common





because of their unexpected and extremely abnormal behavior. As with other psychosis, they are likely to experience hallucinations, particularly of the auditory type. Some individuals may present with various forms of catatonia, including stupor, physical rigidity, expressionlessness, or mutism (not speaking). They may also be experiencing delusions or paranoid thoughts. Approximately 9% of those presenting with a first episode of psychosis receive this diagnosis. Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from this disorder. The age of onset varies, but the average age is mid-30s. In addition, this disorder occurs more frequently in developing nations (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   An important differentiator between brief psychotic disorder and other disorders is that individuals return to pre-onset functioning in a short time. This means that as their symptoms quickly recede, they regain their same level of abilities and functioning. While this disorder shares some psychotic features with substance-induced psychotic disorder, it is different. Brief psychotic disorder is not caused by substance use or withdrawal.
   It is critical that a clinician ascertain the exact time frame involved in both onset and duration in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Brief psychotic disorder can last no longer than one month, or the diagnosis is not applicable. Should it last longer, another disorder from the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders group should be considered. Usually, a very stressful event precedes the onset of this disorder. Therefore, it is important to not only ascertain if a stressor is related to the onset of the disorder, but it is imperative to assess for stress-related conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit the abrupt onset of symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or bizarre behavior and posture. The episode must last at least one day by less than one month with the eventual return to pre-onset level of functioning. Symptoms of this disorder must be distinguished from culturally sanctioned response patterns that may resemble such symptoms. The diagnosis is not given if there is evidence of the direct physiological effects of a medication, a drug of abuse, or a medical condition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).


   The cause of this disorder is not well understood. However, individuals with a family history of bipolar disorder or depression are more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than those who do not. As already noted, extreme stressors often trigger this disorder. Substances, medications, and medical conditions can cause psychotic episodes. In addition to family history and stressors, substances, medications, and medical conditions can cause, complicate, or trigger psychotic disorders. Accordingly, detailed information about such factors should be identified.


Depending on the severity of the symptoms, individuals may require hospitalization for the initial days following the onset of the disorder. During this time, a comprehensive assessment is undertaken to identify the causes and triggers of the disorder. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and to return individuals to their previous level of functioning. Both medication and cognitive behavior therapy are common treatment interventions. Various antipsychotic medication such as Haldol, Risperdal, and Zyprexa are commonly used. In addition to treatment aimed at the reduction of symptoms, it is often recommended that individuals participate in psychoeducation (information sessions) programs aimed at helping them understand their condition. Also, family therapy is beneficial for individuals suffering from brief psychotic disorders. This form of therapy allows other family members to gain insight into the condition and understand how they might support the individual who is suffering in the family setting.



Brief therapy is a form of therapy that can increase an individual’s functioning in a relatively short amount of time.

Definitions
• Acceptance and commitment therapy is a psychological treatment approach that assists individuals to accept what is outside their control and commit to action that enriches their lives. It is also known as ACT.
• Adlerian therapy is a psychological treatment approach that uses encouragement to assist individuals to find constructive actions to deal with their problems while developing an enhanced sense of social interest.
• Behavioral therapy is a psychological treatment approach that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors. It is also referred to as behavioral therapy.
• Biopsychosocial therapy is a psychological treatment approach that focuses on clients’ biological, psychological, and social dynamics and focus interventions on those areas.
• Brief dynamic psychotherapy is a psychological treatment approach that focuses on maladaptive interpersonal patterns and unmet needs, which are treated by facilitating new experiences in therapy.
• Brief reality therapy is a psychological treatment approach that emphasizes problem solving in the here and now. It does not focus on


mental illness, rather on the ability to choose and create a better future.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a psychological treatment approach that focuses on maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Cognitive behavior analysis system of psychotherapy is a psychological approach that focuses on changing thoughts and behaviors by analyzing desired outcomes in contrast to actual outcomes. It is also called CBASP.
• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapy and therapeutic counseling.
• Solution-focused brief therapy is a psychological treatment approach that focuses on strengths and problem solving, and examines an individual’s past ability to cope effectively.


Brief therapies are an assortment of psychotherapy approaches that can effect change in clients in a short amount of time. Some theories have therapeutic processes that can take years to achieve treatment goals, while brief therapy models utilize techniques that influence change rather quickly. Given the limitations of managed care, individuals are often eligible only for a limited amount of therapy sessions. Third-party payers typically expect therapy to be completed in very few sessions and the treatment provided to be effective and long-lasting. As a result of this, brief therapies have become the treatment of choice for many therapists. Brief therapy models are goal oriented and time-limited and focus treatment to address the individual’s strengths and abilities. Rather than looking for the cause of the problem, brief therapies





work with clients to make changes in their lives and improve their functioning. Brief models seek to effect change with clients in as little as just one session. Various brief models have been articulated in the literature.
   Some brief therapies include brief dynamic therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), biopsychosocial therapy, brief Adlerian therapy, acceptance commitment therapy (ACT), brief reality therapy, cognitive behavior analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP), and solution-focused brief therapy. CBT and CBASP are psychological treatment approaches that help clients reduce and modify maladaptive behaviors and cognitions, while brief dynamic therapy works with individuals to examine relationship patterns and unmet needs by changing relational patterns toward a more adaptive approach. Brief Adlerian therapy effects change in clients by helping them implement constructive actions and increase their sense of belonging. ACT assists individuals to accept what is outside their control and commit to action that is in accordance with their goals and values. Solution-focused brief therapy focuses on strengths and problem solving, and examines an individual’s past exceptions to when the problem was not a problem. While other brief models exist, the examples provided earlier utilize different therapeutic strategies and interventions to assist individuals who are seeking therapy services in a time-limited setting.


Brief therapy models were developed by various theoretical proponents. Brief therapies are considered some of the most clinical useful and efficient therapy modalities. Research and application of brief therapy approaches continue to occur at an increasing rate. It is anticipated that brief therapies will outnumber the longer-term therapies.





Bulimia nervosa is a mental disorder characterized by recurrent binge eating with loss of control over one’s eating and compensation for eating.


• Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by refusal to maintain minimal normal body weight along with a fear of weight gain and a distorted body image.
• Binge eating is a pattern of disordered eating consisting of episodes of uncontrolled intake of food.
• Binge eating disorder is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating without subsequent purging episodes.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of counseling or psychotherapy that focuses on changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as CBT.
• Eating disorder is a class of mental disorders that are characterized by difficulties with too much, too little, or unhealthy food intake, and may include distorted body image.

Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder with a characteristic pattern of recurrent binge eating followed by purging. Bulimics overeat because food gives them a feeling of comfort. However, overeating makes them feel out of control. Then, feeling ashamed, guilty, and afraid of gaining weight, they purge. Basically, this disorder represents a loss of control about overeating and the compensatory behavior of purging for the purpose of regaining a sense of control. Individuals with bulimia nervosa tend to be of normal weight and “low calorie” or “careful restrictive” eaters between episodes of bingeing and purging. About 1.0%–1.5% of females have this disorder, which begins in adolescence and remains a pattern through early adulthood. The female-to-male ratio is 10:0 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
This disorder must be distinguished from the
binge/purge subtype of anorexia nervosa. Both bulimia nervosa and this subtype involve binge eating and purging. However, whereas the anorexic is unable to maintain even minimal weight, the bulimic contains purging sufficiently to maintain body weight that is minimally normal or above normal level (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Bulimia nervosa can also be distinguished from binge eating disorder, where there is bingeing but no purging.
   Purging typically involves self-induced vomiting, fasting, overexercising, or using medicines like laxatives to induce diarrhea and/or excessive bowel movements. The binge/purge experience is often hidden, occurring during the night or when alone, and bulimics become skilled at inducing vomiting and using diuretics and exercise. Purging can lead to serious and even life-threatening medical conditions. These include dental problems like tooth decay, gum disease, and loss of tooth enamel that result from acid in the mouth following vomiting. It can also lead to osteoporosis (bone thinning), kidney damage, and fatal cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). Laxative dependence is a common complication of this disorder. Dentists and dental hygienists have a key role in identifying bulimia nervosa since they are often the first to recognize the dental damage caused by purging.


   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a pattern of binge eating followed by methods of purging or compensating to avoid weight gain. It is not the same as the binge/purge pattern in anorexia nervosa. The purging and/or compensation often involves vomiting, the use of laxatives, diets, and/or fasting. In this disorder the individual is preoccupied with thoughts about appearance, shape, and weight. Depending on the number and duration of binge/purge episodes per week, the disorder is given a severity rating of mild, moderate, severe, or extreme. The disorder can range from mild (1–3 episodes of binge/purge per week) to extreme (14 or more episodes per week) based on the frequency and duration of the episodes of bingeing and purging (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The causes and course of this disorder are many and complex. Family history, social factors, and personality traits are usually involved. A family history of obesity or an eating disorder is not uncommon. Expectations for thinness, stressful work situations, divorce, relocation, or loss of a loved one may be involved. It is common in social settings or professions that involve a body performance such as sports, acting, and modeling. Preoccupation with external beauty and “looking good” are common among those with this disorder. Personality traits such as perfectionism, worry, or low self-esteem are common. This disorder may begin with efforts to find social acceptance, attention getting, and the need to please others or seek approval. Sometimes few of these factors are involved, and the disorder begins with the use of purging as a short-term strategy for losing weight.


Clinical treatment of this disorder typically involves counseling and sometimes medications. Unlike anorexia nervosa, treatment of bulimia nervosa does not usually involve hospitalization. The goal of the treatment is to reduce bingeing and purging and to foster recovery from the disorder. Because individuals with this disorder are often diagnosed with mood disorders or substance disorders, particularly involving alcohol and/or stimulants, these conditions must be treated simultaneously. Counseling usually involves cognitive behavior therapy and





nutritional counseling to change certain behavior and thinking patterns. Antidepressant medicines like Prozac may be used to reduce the binge-purging and to treat related depression or anxiety. Treatment of this and related disorders tends to be long term.






• Mobbing is defined as when an individual is bullied by a group of people in any context, including a family, school, social setting, or workplace.
• Victim is the person who has suffered or been harmed as a result of being the target of bullying behavior.



Bullying, also referred to as peer aggression, is defined as repeated acts of aggression, abuse, or intimidation that are inflicted directly or indirectly over time by one or more dominant persons. This behavior involves the interaction among three parties: the bully (aggressor), the victim (target), and the bystander (witness). Generally, bullying is committed from peer to peer. When bullying is inflicted by a group rather than by one individual, it is termed “mobbing.” Three essential components distinguish bullying from other forms of victimization: (1) intentional harm to the victim, (2) repetition of the harmful acts over time, and (3) the existence of a power differential (physically, chronologically, socially, emotionally, psychologically) between

Bullying, or peer aggression, involves intentionally harmful, repeated acts of aggression toward a person, typically a peer, with lesser power.


• Bully, the aggressor, victimizer, or perpetrator of bullying; a person who uses his or her power to intimidate, harass, or harm another person.
• Bullycide refers to a suicide where the victim’s death has been attributed to the victim having been bullied either in person or online.
• Bystander is a person who is present at, observes, or witnesses a particular event or circumstance (such as bullying) but who does not have direct involvement.
• Cyberbullying refers to using technology (texting, e-mailing, chat rooms, social media sites, pictures, etc.) to repeatedly and intentionally degrade, threaten, or humiliate another person.

bully and victim. There are various types of bullying, including physical, verbal, relational, and cyberbullying. Physical bullying entails behaviors like hitting, slapping, punching, pushing, kicking, tripping, spitting, and damaging another person’s property. Insults, name-calling, slurs, threats, and spreading rumors/gossip are forms of verbal bullying. Relational bullying is described as when one uses one’s social influence or popularity to isolate, ignore, exclude, or reject another person. Cyberbullying is a more recent phenomenon whereby aggressors use technological means (texting, pictures, social sites, e-mail, etc.) to bully their victims. Students in grades 6–10 are most likely to be involved in bullying incidents, though bullying has been observed in children as young as three. There are also notable peaks in bullying behavior during the transition years from elementary to middle school and again from middle to high school, pointing to the value of early intervention. Early reports indicated that boys were more likely to engage in physical types of bullying while girls more readily displayed relational bullying. However, recent trends suggest that both boys and girls are





involved in relational types of aggression, with a drastic increase noted in recent times in rates of cyberbullying for both genders. The prevalence of technology in today’s society has greatly contributed to increased incidents of cyberbullying. Accessibility to technology and anonymity issues further complicates this problem. Victims of peer aggression may be targeted for differences in their appearance, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, personality, reputation, or ability. Experts have sought to establish a pattern of behavior for bullies, though no definitive profile exists. It was once believed that bullies harass and torment due to low self-esteem, but this is now considered a myth.
Rather, aggressors are attracted to the attention and sense of power they get from putting others down.
   The word “bully” can be traced back to the mid-16th century when it was first used as a term of endearment, likened to the word “sweetheart” or “lover” (Dutch/ German origin). It was not until the 17th century that the term began to have more of a negative connotation. Reference to the current meaning of bully or bullying increased around the 1970s–1980s and became more commonplace in everyday vernacular in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The popular book, Queen Bees and Wannabees (2009), written by Rosalind Wiseman, exposed the true realities of bullying and relational aggression in girl world. The continued success of the pop culture film, Mean Girls (2004), based on Wise-man’s book, further points to society’s interest in the bullying phenomenon. Wiseman later went on to publish Masterminds and Wingmen (2013), addressing relational bullying from a boy’s perspective.
   As awareness about bullying has increased, more attention has been placed on approaches, policies, and strategies to prevent and combat it. Several have been attempted, ranging in level of effectiveness from zero-tolerance policies, restorative-justice approaches, education and identification training, and punitive measures. Norwegian psychologist Daniel Olweus is considered the pioneer of bullying research. He was the first to examine the prevalence of this problem among school-aged children back in the 1970s. His findings led him to develop a comprehensive approach for addressing bullying school-wide, the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program, which focuses on fostering positive peer relationships and creating safe


environments where students can learn and develop. This program remains a popular evidence-based approach used today. Recent research supports the effectiveness of social-emotional learning programs that also work to create an overall positive school climate.


Studies have linked experiences with bullying to a wide range of negative consequences (physical, behavioral, academic, social, emotional, and psychological). Victims commonly report headaches, sleep problems, nightmares, and bed-wetting. They also report fear and anxiety about attending school and other social events. Bystanders indicate similar concerns. Being victimized also results in lower self-esteem and an increased risk of experiencing depression. “Bullycide,” a term used to describe suicide resulting from peer aggression, is of further concern, as is homicide. There is evidence to support that several school-shooting cases can be traced back to victimization. Success in school can also be affected by bullying. Researchers have tied victimization to increased tardy, absentee, and dropout rates; poorer grades; and more academic struggles. Bullies also experience distinct consequences. Future involvement in spousal abuse, child abuse, and sexual harassment incidents is also more probable for those identified as bullies. In addition, aggressors exhibit lower frustration tolerance, have quicker tempers, and display more impulsive behaviors, which greatly contribute to struggles in school. Poorer grades; increased absentee and dropout rates; substance abuse problems; and high rates of depression, suicide, and self-injurious behaviors have also been noted.
Estimates suggest that some 30%–40% of young-sters, about one out of every four kids, report some level of involvement with bullying on a regular basis. However, these numbers are thought to be grossly underestimated as bullying often goes unrecognized and unreported. Most incidents occur in unsupervised locations such as playgrounds, bathrooms, and hallways, so the true severity of this problem remains unknown. Secrecy also plays a large role, as many victims are scared to report incidents out of fear of retaliation. Bystanders may also be hesitant to report out of concerns that the bully may turn on them next.





   Presently, 49 states have anti-bullying laws (all except Montana). Georgia was the first to pass legislation back in 1999. Legislation varies by state according to reporting procedures and guidelines, requirements, and punishments. Educators, researchers, law enforcement officers, psychologists, counselors, parents, and young people remain interested in investigating and remedying the bullying problem.




The bystander effect, also known as bystander apathy, is a highly researched social psychological phenomenon that occurs when an individual or individuals, who witness dangerous or harmful situations, stand by without offering assistance to the victim or victims.


• Bystander is a person who is present at, observes, or witnesses a particular event or circumstance (such as bullying) but who does not have direct involvement.


• Diffusion of responsibility suggests that bystanders rationalize their hesitance, reluctance, or lack of intervening on a victim’s behalf due to a belief that others present will take responsibility.

When dangerous, harmful events or emergency situations occur and an onlooker or onlookers do nothing to intervene, stop, or assist the victim(s), this is referred to as “the bystander effect.” This phenomenon has also been termed “bystander apathy,” describing what appears to be relative disregard or lack of empathy for what the victim is experiencing. The probability of intervening also appears to decrease as the number of bystanders present increases. Various aspects of this effect have been researched and identified by social psychologists that help explain why the effect occurs. These variables include situational ambiguity, familiarity with the environment, sense of social responsibility, level of group cohesiveness, and diffusion of responsibility.


Sociologists and psychologists have been researching the bystander effect for decades beginning with the groundbreaking study conducted by Bibb Latané and John Darley in 1968. Their interest was piqued following the publicized brutal rape and murder of “Kitty” Genovese by Winston Moseley on March 13, 1964, in Queens, New York. Though it was determined during trial proceedings that a dozen or so people had witnessed various pieces of the attack, media reports initially indicated much higher numbers (36–38), which resulted in public outrage and increasing concerns regarding bystander responsibility. (It was also later publicized that, during the Genovese attack, one person did call the police and one woman rushed to Genovese’s side after the attack.) Latané and Darley proceeded with a series of experiments to investigate bystander behavior. Essentially, these studies consisted of staged events whereby a participant or group of participants were placed in emergency and nonemergency situations and observed to see whether they would intervene as well as how long it would take them to act.





Diffusion of responsibility, or the reluctance of observers to initiate assistance or involve themselves when others are around, was suggested as one possible explanation of the phenomenon. Witnesses often believe that someone else, perhaps an individual more qualified, will step up. Others may prefer not to get involved due to fear or intimidation.

Current Status and Results
Research on the bystander effect suggests that whether onlookers perceive the situation as an emergency or not matters. The more serious a situation is viewed, the faster the bystander reacts. An additional finding shows that when a person is alone, rather than with one or more people, he or she also tends to react more swiftly. Degree of connection to the victim is also a contributing factor. Bystanders with some relationship or tie to the victim are more likely to assist. Several examples of the bystander effect have been recorded throughout history. Recent interest in this phenomenon has focused on youth’s hesitance to intervene in bullying situations, with experts recommending school


violence-prevention programs that address bystander interventions in order to produce lasting chance






Caffeine-related disorders are a group of disorders characterized by excessive consumption of caffeine. The disorders in this group include caffeine intoxication and caffeine withdrawal.


• Addictive refers to a persistent, compulsive dependence on a substance or a behavior.
• Antianxiety medications are prescribed drugs that relieve anxiety symptoms. They are also called anxiolytics and tranquilizers.
• Caffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant that is derived from plants, which may be addictive or cause withdrawal symptoms.
• Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by state of panic (intense fear of a known danger) or anxiety (intense worry or an imagined danger) as a result of the consumption of caffeine.
• Caffeine-induced sleep disorder is a sleep disorder characterized by disturbed sleep as a result of the consumption of caffeine.
• 
Substance-related disorders are a group of mental disorders that are characterized by the problematic use of substances.
• Withdrawal symptoms are the symptoms (nervousness, headaches, insomnia, etc.) that occur when an individual who is addicted to a substance (drugs or alcohol) stops using the substance.


Caffeine-related disorders represent a group of mental disorders that result from excessive consumption of caffeine. This group is part of the substance-related disorders. The two primary disorders of this category are caffeine intoxication and caffeine withdrawal. Because they differ from this group in the severity of symptoms, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder and caffeine-induced sleep disorder are not included.
   Caffeine consumption is common and widespread in many cultures. Typically, it is found in coffee, tea, energy drinks, and soda. But it is also in chocolate, in many over-the-counter medicines, and in weight loss supplements. In the United States, it has been estimated that 85% of the population consume caffeine frequently (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Consequently, these disorders affect people in significant numbers. It is therefore important that clinicians are able to recognize these disorders as well as rule out other similar disorders and treat accordingly.












  Caffeine intoxication. Caffeine intoxication is a disorder that results from the consumption of large amounts of caffeine. Individuals diagnosed with this disorder have often consumed 250 mg of caffeine or more, roughly equivalent to 2.5 cups of coffee. To be given this diagnosis individuals must exhibit symptoms that may include agitation, apprehension, excitability, rapid heartbeat, flushed face, frequent urination, and difficulty sleeping. Such symptoms must be distressing to the individual or disrupt daily functioning.
   Both children and older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than middle-aged adults. It is estimated that 7% of the population may experience many of the earlier-mentioned symptoms every year (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Treatment of this disorder may include the administration of antianxiety medication to reduce symptoms and laxatives to flush out the caffeine. If the caffeine was


ingested recently, activated carbon (a substance that readily absorbs chemicals) may also be administered. Intense symptoms typically last four to six hours and then stop. This means that most individuals will recover fully even without treatment.
Caffeine withdrawal. Caffeine withdrawal is a disorder that results from the abrupt termination of caffeine consumption after having consumed the substance for an extended period of time. Symptoms of this disorder often include migraine (most common), inability to concentrate, moodiness, or symptoms similar to the flu. Typically, symptoms occur within two days following the last ingestion of caffeine. It is estimated that this disorder affects roughly half of those who stop caffeine after extended use (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). One of the most effective ways to reduce caffeine withdrawal symptoms is to provide the individual a small dose of caffeine. Since headaches are the most common withdrawal symptom, individuals may be encouraged to take an over-the-counter headache remedy (like Bayer aspirin) which contains caffeine.




The psychological aspects of cancer include symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress, as well as spiritual–existential issues. These may be experienced by the individual with cancer or caregivers.


• Adjustment disorder is a mental disorder characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable





stressor that is significantly distressing or causes impairment.
• Anxiety is a negative emotional state characterized by feelings of nervousness, worry, and apprehension about an imagined danger.
• Chronic disease is a disease entity which usually does not have a single cause, a specific onset, nor a stable set of symptoms. While cure may be possible, it is unlikely for advanced levels of the disease process. It is also referred to as chronic medical conditions.
• Depression is an emotional state characterized by feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, guilt, or reduced ability to enjoy life. It is not considered a mental disorder unless it significantly disrupts one’s daily functioning.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder characterized by nightmares, irritability, anxiety, emotional numbing, and recurrent flashbacks of a traumatic event that an individual experienced or witnessed. It is also referred to as PTSD.
• Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is a mental disorder characterized by emotional factors that worsen a medical condition.
• Relapse is the recurrence of symptoms after a period of improvement or recovery.


While some may consider cancer only a medical condition, there are many psychological aspects that result from this chronic disease. A cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment can result in significant psychological distress. The extent of distress depends on the type of cancer, time since diagnosis, degree of physical and social impairment, and prognosis. Some individuals


may not develop symptoms severe enough to qualify for a diagnosis but may still experience psychological problems. Feelings of anger, guilt, sadness, and fear are common in those living with chronic disease. Others may qualify for a mental health disorder diagnosis. These include adjustment disorders or disorders of depression and anxiety.
   Common psychological problems faced by individuals with cancer are anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depression, spiritual–existential issues, and interpersonal (relationship) issues. Individuals with cancer may experience anxiety for a number of reasons. These include fears about the cancer progressing or returning after remission (relapse). They may also be due to financial problems resulting from medical expenses, inability to perform previous duties at work or with family, or fears about dying. Experiencing a life-threatening medical condition is one criterion for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder according to the DSM-5. Depression may be brought on by the loss of familiar routines in daily life. Hopelessness, low self-esteem, and feelings of vulnerability that are associated with cancer may add to this. Individuals may also experience spiritual and existential issues. These involve loss of faith, conflicts in their relationship with God, and finding meaning in their illness. The psychological aspects of cancer impact family members and caregivers as well. Fears of losing a loved one and the stress associated with caring for an individual with cancer can lead to symptoms. Some individuals may develop mental health disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder themselves. This is particularly true for parents of children with cancer. Such stress can lead to a decline in care and increased distress for the individual with cancer.
The psychological problems associated with cancer can also lead to worsening physical symptoms. The DSM-5 diagnosis, psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, describes this relationship. Stress can cause tumors to grow and spread and increase feelings of helplessness. The relationship between psychological factors and cancer can be positive as well, however. Those who are able to manage stress tend to have better outcomes. Exercise, meditation, social support, and counseling are examples of activities





used to cope with the psychological problems associated with cancer.



Cannabis use disorder is a mental disorder characterized by cannabis (marijuana) use, which leads to significant problems for the user.


• Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain which involves compulsive and uncontrolled pursuit of reward or relief with substance use or other compulsive behaviors.
• Alcoholism is a general term for the compulsive and uncontrolled consumption of alcohol to the detriment of the drinker’s health, relationships, and social standing.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Executive functions are high-level cognitive abilities such as planning, organizing, reasoning, decision making, and problem solving that influence more basic abilities such as attention, memory, and motor skills.


• Motivational interviewing is a counseling strategy for helping individuals to discover and resolve their ambivalence to change. It is also referred to as MI.
• Narcotics Anonymous is a self-help and support group for those addicted to drugs to help them learn how to live without the use of mind and mood-altering chemicals. It is a Twelve-Step Program.
• Psychoactive is a drug or substance that has a significant effect on mental processes. There are five groups of psychoactive drugs: opioids, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and cannabis.
• Substance-related and addictive disorders are a group of mental disorders that include substance disorders characterized by physiological dependence, drug-seeking behavior, tolerance, and social withdrawal. This group also includes the non-substance disorder of gambling.
• Twelve-Step Program is a self-help group whose members attempt recovery from various addictions and compulsions based on a plan called the Twelve Steps.


Cannabis use disorder is one of the substance-related and addictive disorders. It is characterized by a problematic pattern of cannabis use which leads to significant distress or disrupted daily functioning. Problematic use of marijuana includes short-term physical and mental effects. Physical effects include mild sedation, impaired eye–hand coordination, increased appetite (“munchies”), and enhancement of senses. For example, food tends to taste and smell better and with increased appetite can lead to overeating. Mental effects include confusion, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, exaggerated mood and personality, short-term memory difficulties, and time distortion. Mental effects can also include distortions of sound and color and possible hallucinations. The effects can be unique to the individual. So, while most users will be relaxed, some will be energized by marijuana use. Some may use it only for a specific purpose, such as to be more






sociable or to hear music more deeply or differently, while others use it daily. Cannabis is probably the most widely used illicit psychoactive drug in the world. It is used by approximately 5% of adults in the United States, with more males than female users (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   Long-term effects include respiratory problems, immune system impact, and acute mental effects. Although there is not a direct cancer relationship between long-term marijuana use and cancer such as there is with nicotine use, other respiratory problems include acute and chronic bronchitis and lung tissue damage. Some individuals will experience a great deal of anxiety and paranoia while using marijuana that persists after usage. While not common, cannabis use can precipitate psychosis in those with a predisposition toward it.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a

problematic pattern of cannabis use, which leads to significant impairment or distress. This must occur within a 12-month period. This includes taking the substance in larger amounts or for longer than intended. It means wanting to cut down or stop using the substance but not achieving this goal. It involves spending much time getting, using, or recovering from use of the substance. This disorder also involves cravings and urges to use the substance, and continuing to use, even when it causes problems in relationships. It involves failure to meet obligations at home, work, or school because of substance use. It also means reducing or stopping important social, work, or recreational activities because of substance use. This disorder involves repeated substance use even when it is physically dangerous. Despite knowing the risks of the physical and psychological problems that are caused or made worse by the substance, use of it continues. It means tolerance develops (needing more of





it to get the desired effect). Finally, it involves withdrawal symptoms, which can be relieved by taking more of the substance (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   This disorder has many of the same root causes as other substance disorders. The desire for a “high” along with the belief that marijuana is harmless often leads to experimentation during adolescence. However, regular cannabis users typically experience withdrawal symptoms, including stomach pain, aggression, anxiety, and irritability. Many frequent cannabis users are believed to continue using in order to avoid these unpleasant symptoms. Early use of this drug is associated with pervasive cognitive, social, and work-related problems in later life. Long-term use leads to comprised brain activity, particularly cognitive and executive functions (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Easy availability, higher potency, and lower price for cannabis may all contribute to the increase in cannabis-related disorders.


Treatment for this disorder is similar to the treatment of other substance disorders. The goal of treatment is abstinence. Treatment approaches range from inpatient hospitalization and drug rehabilitation centers for detoxification to outpatient programs. Motivational interviewing is useful in identifying reasons to stop using cannabis and to increase motivation and readiness for treatment. Then, cognitive behavior therapy can be used to identify the beliefs, behaviors, and situations that trigger use and cravings. From these clinicians can develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of relapse. Because cannabis addiction is considered a chronic condition, long-term treatment to maintain sobriety and prevent relapse is necessary. This often includes continuing in therapy and/or a Twelve-Step Program like Narcotics Anonymous. For heavy users suffering from withdrawal symptoms, treatment with antianxiety and antidepressant medication may be used.




• Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that affects behavior, thinking, and emotion, which make distinguishing between real and unreal experiences difficult. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, thought and communication disturbances, and withdrawal from others.
• Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by psychotic features. These disorders include schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder, and delusional disorder.


Capgras syndrome is a specific delusion in which an individual believes that one’s friend, family member, or spouse has been replaced by an imposter who is identical in appearance. This belief may be of a short duration or chronic. This disorder is named for the French psychiatrist Joseph Capgras (1873–1950), who was the first clinician to recognize and write about the disorder. It is also known as Capgras delusion and delusion misidentification.
   The occurrence of Capgras syndrome is unknown but is considered to be rare. This disorder is not a specific diagnosis outlined in the DSM-5. However, it





does qualify as a symptom of the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, including delusional disorder and schizophrenia, which it is most commonly associated with. It follows that individuals who experience Capgras syndrome may be diagnosable with one of the previously mentioned disorders.
   The specific cause of this disorder is unknown. For individuals who have a primary diagnosis that includes delusional components, the cause is most likely related to the same origin of the primary diagnosis. For those who do not have a delusional disorder, it has been theorized that brain dysfunction caused by illness (e.g., dementia) or brain injury can cause this disorder to manifest. As it pertains to brain injury, it has been suggested that damage to the brain in the areas related to emotional response may be to blame. An individual may see the familiar face of a loved one and be able to recognize it but not experience the emotional response typically associated with that person. Consequently, the individual forms the belief that this person is not the person he or she once knew.


Treatment of Capgras syndrome in someone with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders is usually the same as the primary diagnosis. Many of the methods employed in these psychotic disorders are effective in treating the characteristic delusion of this syndrome. Specific therapies may include cognitive therapy and antipsychotic medications.





The purpose of career assessment is to obtain information about a person’s interests, abilities, talents, and capacity for growth related to his or her aspirations. In using career assessment tools, a trained practitioner, such as a career counselor or advisor, guides the client toward appropriate placement in hopes of helping the person pursue his or her work-related goals.


• Career counselor, or vocational counselor, is a counseling professional who has received specialized coursework, training, and certification in career-related guidance in order to provide advisement to persons seeking assistance in this area.
• Interest inventory is a type of career assessment that gauges what a person likes or is interested in.
• Self-assessment (career) is a self-reporting instrument used to gather information about a person’s values, personality, interests, skills, and abilities.



Career assessment describes the process of using tools, tests, questionnaires, and inventories to determine a person’s abilities and skills related to work. They are used to identify strengths and weaknesses to help guide possible job choices. Career assessments refer to the specific tests that are used to acquire knowledge about a person’s career options. Both quantitative and





qualitative information are generated from these tests. Counselors who have been schooled in career or vocational guidance typically conduct them. However, other professionals who have been trained in this type of assessment, including mental health practitioners and educational advisors, may also perform these tests. There are various types of career assessments, and each uses a different type of criteria to gather information. Interest inventories gauge what one’s likes, preferences, or activities one is drawn to. Other tools assess a person’s values or what criteria are most important to a person in terms of the person’s career. For example, one may value flexibility in work schedule over salary. Aptitude and skills tests seek to determine what a person is best suited for in terms of natural talents or skill sets. Personality inventories place individuals in various type categories and attempt to link these to different careers known to be rewarding for those types.


The foundation for career assessment was laid several decades ago in the early part of the 20th century. A growing need to find proper job placements for soldiers returning from war as well as a new emphasis on math and science preparation in the field of education spawned the career guidance counseling movement. From this came many changes including the development of career assessment tools, such as the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Strong-Interest Inventory, and Holland’s Codes.
   The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator assessment is a psychometric questionnaire that was developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers in 1962. The MBTI measures a person’s perceptions of the world and decision-making process. The theoretical basis for the assessment is the principle of typology. Carl Jung was the first psychologist to propose the idea of types back in the 1920s. He theorized that there were four main ways that people experience the world, through sensation, intuition, feeling, or thinking. The MBTI emphasizes the value of personal preferences and how these guide our interests, values, needs, and motivation.
   Another career assessment tool is the Holland Codes. Psychologist John Holland developed these codes based on six personality types: Realistic,


Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional, each reflective of how a person approaches life. Individuals are categorized based on their top three types. Occupations are also classified and then matches are based on what personality types fit those careers best.
   The Strong Interest Inventory (SII), developed by psychologist E. K. Strong, Jr., in 1927, is one of the most popular career assessments. The most recent version (2004) is based on the Holland Codes and is used readily in by career advisors and guidance counselors. The goal of the SII is to determine a person’s top interest and use that information to decide on an appropriate career choice.

Career assessment tools have been criticized for their lack of validity and reliability. Though these types of tests can be valuable in obtaining useful information, they should be interpreted only by trained professionals and should not be viewed as an end-all determinant. Many of these tools gauge how a person reports feeling, thinking, behaving, or preferring at a given time, which arguably is likely to change over time. However, research trends indicate that a person will change careers at least once in his or her lifetime so career assessments are useful vehicles to guide this process and help a person determine the best suitable job options.



Career counseling is a collaborative process in which a counselor or advisor works with a person to help





identify personal interests, abilities, and goals so the person can make wise career-related decisions.


• Career counselor, or vocational counselor, is a counseling professional who has received specialized coursework, training, and certification in career-related guidance in order to provide advisement to persons seeking assistance in this area.


Career counseling describes a process in which a counselor and counselee form a collaborative relationship focused on identifying and acting on career-related goals. A career counselor employs various techniques that may include individual or group-based discussion, as well as the use of self-assessments, including interest inventories, personality tests, and aptitude tests. By uncovering a person’s interests and abilities, the career counselor seeks to expose the counselee to various job possibilities that may be suitable. Goals of a career counseling session may be to bring about self-awareness, identify personal strengths and weaknesses, develop short-term and long-term goals, accept responsibility for one’s actions, and maintain the proper level of motivation.
   Counseling focused on career-related areas can be provided to people of any age and at any stage of their career path. Topics do not have to focus solely on possible job or career changes but may also surround workplace frustrations, decisions about pursuing further education, and/or how to balance personal and professional life. People seeking career counseling services can meet with counselors in a one-on-one setting or in small groups. Though these are the most common settings, career counseling activities may also be presented to larger groups in a classroom or workshop environment. Small group sessions may last anywhere from four to six sessions. An initial or intake career counseling session may entail the use of assessments that will help determine the person’s interests, aptitude, and skill sets.



The practice of career counseling has its foundation in career counseling theory. Career counseling theories are different from career theories in that career theories provide possible explanations for how people experience their careers and work environments along with how they make job-related decisions. On the other hand, career counseling theories attempt to provide possible approaches to assist a person along his or her career development path. Several types of career counseling theories exist and can determine the approach, techniques, activities, and assessment tools that a career counselor chooses to employ with a client.
   Career counseling services began at the turn of the 20th century with Frank Parsons and the vocational guidance movement. Parsons outlined a career decision-making process whereby people could identify their aptitudes and interests and align them to a fitting career choice. Current theorists, such as John Holland, refer to this concept as person-environment-fit.
   Career counselors typically receive specialized education, training, and/or certification. Most hold a master’s level degree in counseling with a specific focus on career assessment, development, theory, and advisement techniques. Professional school counselors, or guidance counselors, obtain coursework and training pertaining to career counseling topics for students in grade prekindergarten through 12th.


Career counseling takes place in different settings. Career counseling centers may be free standing or located in educational settings including community colleges and universities. Recent mandates require that career domains be covered in the kindergarten through 12th-grade curriculum. However, how educational systems go about this can vary according to state, district, and school setting. Professional school counselors have been charged with covering career development in their guidance and counseling curriculums. Furthermore, the American School Counselor Association National Model mandates that career standards be incorporated into comprehensive developmental guidance





programs. School counseling curriculums may cover career domains in a variety of direct counseling services, including classroom guidance, small group counseling, and individual counseling. Again, the delivery system may also vary according to grade level. For example, high school students may require more individualized career guidance services, so one-on-one advising may occur more often at this level.




Career development refers to an ongoing, lifelong process of learning about oneself and developing new skills in relation to work. This process can be influenced by several factors including psychological, educational, physical, economical, and sociological.


Career development refers to how people relate to the world of work and their role in it. This ongoing process involves managing one’s career either within an organization or between organizations for the purpose of attaining specific career goals and aspirations. Several factors contribute to the development and success of a career over the lifespan, including personality and trait factors, developmental factors, and systemic factors. These factors have been outlined as the basis of different career development theories.


   Career development can be defined within two separate contexts: organizational and personal. When defining the term from an organizational perspective, career development refers to how one manages one’s career within an organization or between organizations. It also includes how these organizations structure advancement within the company ( how one progresses in career goals). From a personal perspective, career development is defined as the combination of physical, psychological, sociological, educational, and economic factors that influence the nature and significance of work for a person over his or her lifetime. These factors can also impact one’s career patters, decision-making style, sense of self, and personal values.
   Prior to the late 1960s, the term career development was more commonly referred to as vocational development and its practice as career guidance or vocational guidance. The more recent term, “career development,” emerged in the later part of the 20th century and has continued to evolve in the 21st century. Career development derived from the vocational guidance movement. Demographic, economic, and societal changes in the United States during this time urged leaders to respond to growing demands in educational and career domains. Pressure to compete with other nations thus resulted in a need for career guidance and career development practices. The purpose of career development then was to help determine a person’s aptitude and ability and properly place the person in a fitting career.
   Frank Parsons, the father of the vocational guidance movement, offered a three-step model for counselors to use to guide people through the career development process. He proposed that first, one should have a clear understanding of oneself and one’s interests, abilities, talents, and limitations. Second, the person should be educated on what careers are out there that would be a good match for his or her aptitudes, and furthermore, the person should have a working knowledge of the requirements needed in order to be successful in that line of work. With this comes the practical knowledge related to advantages and disadvantages of those career paths. Third, one must have a reasonable ability to incorporate what was learned in the first two steps in order to make the best decision possible.



A person should be introduced to career development early on in life in school if not at home. Though career development has been a focal point of education in elementary and secondary schools since the mid-1900s, specific standards were not outlined in curriculum until much later. The American School Counselor Association’s first set of National Standards, developed in 1995, outlined three domain areas that should be the focus of guidance and counseling standards for all students in K-12 settings. These three domains are academic, personal/social, and career development. Career decision making remains an integral part of a student’s future success in the world of work.



Caregivers are those who help others who by reason of age, illness, or disability are unable to live self-sufficiently.


A caregiver is a person designated as responsible for the care of someone else who suffers from poor mental health or physical disability or whose health is impaired by sickness or old age. The general term “caregiver” refers to both professional health-care workers and untrained, semiskilled relatives or friends of disabled people.  Professional  caregivers  include  graduate


school–educated nurses, postsecondary trained assistants, and high school graduates. These professionals also include registered nurses, personal care assistants, or respite care workers. Duties involved in these professional roles range from the provision of medical care to self-help skills and beyond.
   Family members, friends, and other relatives of people with disabilities or illnesses also serve as caregivers. Usually these informal caregivers are unpaid and are expected to help the individuals they care for with their daily living activities such as cleaning, cooking, and paying bills. In recent years however, the range of duties has increased to include some traditionally performed only by nursing staff. These duties include administering prescribed medications, dealing as intermediary with doctors and nurses on behalf of the one they care for, and helping the patient with intimate activities such as bathing or dressing, as well as activities such as exercise or physiotherapy. Often caregivers perform these activities over many years and with increasing difficulty as the patient’s or relative’s condition worsens. Caregivers themselves age and encounter their own physical, psychological, and mental limitations.


In 2009 it was estimated that there were over 60 million people in the United States who were acting as caregivers for others in some capacity. Almost 75% of these people were female and most were between 35 and 59 years of age. With an aging population and limited societal services for individuals who cannot live self-sufficiently, the role of caregiver has become a very common and necessary function in modern society. Caregivers are especially necessary in the beginning stages of debilitating conditions like dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. When these patients require assistance mostly to cope with normal daily activities, it is usually relatives or friends who provide the necessary help.
   Many nonprofessional caregivers face great challenges in adjusting to their role and its physical and psychological demands. They are often in relationships of familial intimacy with the patients for whom they are responsible. Even though they often say that they find the opportunity to provide care for a loved







one rewarding, it is also true that stress and burnout characterize many caregivers especially after what may be years of continuous responsibility. This condition of exhaustion or discouragement is often referred to as caregiver syndrome.
   It is clear that taking care of the caregiver is a challenge for society. Caregivers must have support themselves in order to do their jobs effectively and efficiently. One of the best supports is for the caregiver to get a temporary but regular break from the demands of caregiving for a patient or family member. Psychoeducation and support activities, such as support groups













• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a diagnostic classification framework that characterizes mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria. It is used by clinicians to diagnose mental disorders. The most current version is DSM-5.
• Maladaptive pattern refers to a pattern that is dysfunctional or unhealthy.
• Pattern is a description of an individual’s characteristic way of perceiving, thinking, and acting.

A case conceptualization is a clinical strategy for obtaining and organizing information about a client, explaining the client’s situation and maladaptive pattern, guiding and focusing treatment, anticipating challenges and roadblocks, and preparing for successful termination. While many therapists develop conceptualizations to guide their practice, not all therapists explicitly articulate these conceptualizations because they are not sufficiently confident with this competency. There are a number of internal and external reasons for developing and articulating a case conceptualization. The most important internal reason is that a case conceptualization enables therapists to experience a sense of confidence in their work. This confidence is then communicated to the client, which strengthens the client’s trust in the therapist and belief that therapy can and will make a difference.


Since at least 2005, case conceptualizations, previously called case formulations, were a requisite for the effective provision of psychotherapy. There are at least three external reasons for this trend. The first reason is the accountability demand by third-party payers that counselors and therapists justify their treatment with clients. Receiving authorization and payment to treat a client requires documentation of a compelling rationale for treatment. The second reason is the movement toward empirically supported treatment, which emphasizes the use of case conceptualizations. The third reason is that the diagnostic manuals, such as DSM-5,


are largely descriptive and do not provide explanation for causes, precipitants, maintaining factors, or treatment interventions. In contrast, a case conceptualization provides a rationale for all these factors and a link between diagnosis and treatment.
   A case conceptualization is essentially a summary statement consisting of four components. The first is a diagnostic formulation that provides a description of the client’s presenting situation and its perpetuants or triggering factors. It answers the “What happened?” question and usually includes a DSM-5 diagnosis. The second is a clinical formulation that provides a compelling explanation of the client’s presenting symptoms, issues, and maladaptive pattern. It answers the “Why did it happen?” question. The third is the cultural formulation that provides a cultural explanation of the client’s presentation and the impact of cultural factors on the client’s personality. It answers the “What role does culture play?” question. The fourth is the treatment formulation that provides an explicit blueprint for intervention planning. It answers the “How can it be changed?” questions, contains treatment goals and specific interventions, and anticipates challenges in achieving these goals.




Case management is a collaborative process between a case manager and an individual and his or her family to assess, plan, coordinate, evaluate, and advocate for the individual’s health needs.


• Case managers are health-care professionals who work with individuals and families to





plan, coordinate, and monitor the outcomes of health-care services.
• Evidence-based practice is a form of practice that is based on the integration of the best research evidence with clinical expertise and client values.
• Health Maintenance Organization is an organization that provides or arranges managed care.
• Managed care is a system of health care that controls costs by placing limits on physicians’ fees and by restricting access to certain medical procedures and providers.
• Practice is a method or process used to accomplish a goal or objective.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.



Case management has two functions (purposes). The first is to advocate for the client after determining health and mental health needs. The second is to coordinate resources and ensure that the client’s needs are satisfied. Case managers are an integral part of case management. Their job is to assess the client’s needs to determine the appropriate services to fulfill those needs. They then develop a detailed plan, which includes the services of health-care providers, psychiatrists, psychotherapists, psychological evaluation, substance abuse programs, and life skills counseling. Case manager also works with other agencies and professionals to ensure that clients’ needs, including living arrangements, are met. Case management involves a case-by-case evaluation of clients’ need for services. The need is compared to the cost of services and available funding for services. Case management attempts to ethically match appropriate health-care services with client needs. It assists in managing health problems as well as life care planning.
First and foremost, the measure of the effectiveness of
case management is its advocacy for the client.


   While case management and psychotherapy appear to be similar, they are actually quite different. The primary focus of psychotherapy is to develop a therapeutic alliance (relationship) with a client and then work collaboratively to effect a basic change in the client’s personality and pattern of functioning. In contrast, while a good working relationship and collaboration with a client are essential for case management to be effective, the goal is not to effect basic changes in the client’s personality and pattern of functioning. Rather, it is to coordinate the services of all providers involved with the client, including psychotherapists. It should be noted, however, that occasionally, a psychotherapist may function briefly in the case management role when a client does not have a designated case manager.


Case management has its roots in managed care and Health Maintenance Organizations. Managed care was established to increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of health care. Case management can and does have a critical role in managed care. This is particularly the case when a client has serious, complex, or long-standing health problems that require the coordination of many health providers and services. In this respect, case management has a unique role on the health-care team.
   Over the years, case management has become a recognized health-care profession. The Case Management Society of America began in 1990. It was established to assist in defining and promoting the profession of case management. Since 1993, the Commission on Case Manager Certification has awarded the Certified Case Manager designation to professionals who meet certification standards.
   Case management systems range in size, bureaucracy, and the number of cases to be managed. Some case management systems are overloaded with clients. The effectiveness of case management is directly related to the amount of time spent with a client. Most frequently, case management is utilized with the elderly, disabled, or chronically ill. Finally, it should be noted that changes to the health-care system in the United States have increasingly impacted the practice of case management.

Case managers are health-care professionals who work together with individuals and families to assess, plan, coordinate, evaluate, and advocate for the individual’s health needs.


• Case management is a collaborative process between a case manager and an individual and his or her family to assess, plan, coordinate, evaluate, and advocate for the individual’s health needs.
• Evidence-based practice is a form of practice that is based on integration of the best research evidence with clinical experience and client values.
• Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) is an organization that provides or arranges managed care.
• Managed care is a system of health care that controls costs by placing limits on physicians’ fees and by restricting access to certain medical procedures and providers.
• Practice is a method or process used to accomplish a goal or objective.


• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.



Case managers have two essential functions (job purposes). The first is to manage advocacy efforts for clients’ health and mental health needs. This advocacy occurs after the case manager works to determine what a client’s health needs are. The second function includes the coordination of resources necessary to meet those needs. It also includes working with other agencies and professionals to ensure that client needs are thoroughly evaluated, monitored, and treated. Case managers evaluate clients’ need for services on a case-by-case basis. They strive to make the most ethical decisions possible regarding matching health services with clients’ needs, while considering cost of treatment and available funding. Highly effective case managers successfully advocate and efficiently coordinate services for their clients.
   While case managers’ and psychotherapists’ functions appear to be similar, they are actually quite different. Psychotherapists focus primarily on developing a therapeutic alliance (relationship) with a client and then collaboratively work to effect basic changes in the client’s personality and pattern of functioning. In contrast, while effective case managers establish a good working relationship, the purpose of their job is not to effect basic changes in the client’s personality and pattern of functioning. Rather, case managers coordinate with all providers of health services required by clients’ needs, which often include psychotherapists. However, when a client does not have a case manager, his or her psychotherapist can function briefly in the case management role. Case managers, on the other hand, are not typically trained to function as a psychotherapist.

The coordination of health services has evolved throughout the years and has been the responsibility





of various health-care professionals. The modern case manager, described earlier, has its roots in managed care and HMOs. Managed care was established to increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of health care in the 1970s. In 1990, the Case Management Society of America (CMSA) was founded. CMSA assisted in defining and promoting professional case managers. Since 1993, the Commission of Case Manager Certification has awarded the Certified Case Manager designation to professionals who meet certification standards.

Catatonic disorders are mental disorders characterized by catatonia or disturbances in muscle movement often involving rigid body postures.


• Antipsychotic medications are prescription drugs used to treat psychotic disorders. They are also referred to as neuroleptics or antipsychotics.
• Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a history of manic episodes (bipolar I disorder), mixed, or hypomanic episodes (bipolar II disorder), usually with one or more major depressive episodes.


• Catatonia is a condition of immobility with muscle rigidity or inflexibility and, at times, overactivity and excitability.
• Delirium is sudden and severe confusion due to changes in brain function that occur in mental and physical illness.
• Delusions are fixed false beliefs that persist despite contrary evidence.
• Depressive disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a sad or irritable mood and cognitive and physical changes that significantly disrupt the individual’s daily routine.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Electroconvulsive therapy is a procedure in which electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure in order to quickly reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. It is also referred to as ECT.
• Hallucinations are false or distorted sensory perceptions that appear to be real perceptions that are generated by the mind rather than external stimuli.
• Psychotic disorder is a severe mental disorder characterized by psychotic features.
• Psychotic features are symptoms characteristic of psychotic disorders. They include delusions, hallucinations, and negative symptoms (lack of initiative and diminished emotional expression).
• Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are a group of DSM-5 mental disorders characterized by psychotic features. They include schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and catatonic disorders.
• Specifier is an extension to a diagnosis that further clarifies the course, severity, or type of features of a disorder or illness.





Catatonic disorders are classified with the DSM-5 schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Basic to all catatonic disorders is catatonia. It is characterized by a psychomotor (mental processes and physical movement) disturbance that may involve decreased motor activity, dismissiveness during an interview or physical examination, or excessive or strange motor activity. The psychomotor disturbance in an individual may range from being unresponsive to agitated. Motor immobility and dismissiveness may be severe or moderate. Excessive and strange motor behaviors may be simple or complex. The most common presentation is maintaining stiffened and rigid body postures for long periods. In some cases, an individual may alternate between decreased and excessive motor activity. Individuals exhibiting severe stages of catatonia may need supervision from a caretaker to avoid harming themselves or others. Furthermore, catatonia has potential risks, which include exhaustion, malnutrition, extreme fever, and self-harm. Catatonia is a condition that can occur in several disorders, including neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, and depressive disorders, and other medical conditions. While catatonia is not a specific disorder in DSM-5, DSM-5 does recognize catatonia associated with other mental disorders (e.g., psychotic disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, or other mental disorders). There are three types of catatonic disorders in DSM-5. They include catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier), catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, and unspecified catatonia. Following are brief descriptions of each of these disorders.
  Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier). Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier) may be applied when criteria are met for catatonia during the course of psychotic, neurological, depressive, bipolar, or other mental health disorders. The catatonia specifier is appropriate to use when an individual has characteristics of psychomotor disturbance and involves at least 3 of the 12 diagnostic features indicated in the DSM-5. Some of the diagnostic features include not actively relating to the environment, motionlessness maintained over a long period, resistance to positioning

by the examiner, opposition to instructions, and inappropriate posture maintained over a long period. Individuals with this disorder may also exhibit a detailed caricature of normal actions, repetitive movements, agitation, disapproving facial expressions, and mimicking another individual’s speech and movements. The majority of catatonia cases involve individuals with bipolar and depressive disorders. However, up to 35% of individuals with catatonia have schizophrenia and are usually diagnosed in inpatient settings (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Catatonia can occur as a side effect of medications. Before any of the disorders related to the catatonia specifier can be diagnosed, a variety of other medical conditions need to be excluded. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition.
Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition is the presence of catatonia that is found to be caused by the psychological effects of another medical condition. Catatonia is diagnosed when at least 3 of the 12 clinical features indicated in the DSM-5 are present. The diagnostic features of this disorder are exactly the same as the one’s listed earlier in catatonia associated with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier). There must be evidence from a physical examination, an individual’s history, or laboratory results that the disturbance is the direct result of another medical condition. This diagnosis is not given if it is better accounted for by another disorder (e.g., depressive episode) or if it takes place solely during the course of a delirium. The disturbance (catatonia) must cause significant impairment and distress in an individual’s occupational, social, or other important areas of life. A number of medical conditions may cause catatonia, particularly neurological conditions, such as head trauma, inflammation of the brain, and disease of blood vessels in the brain (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Unspecified catatonia. Unspecified catatonia is a category that applies to the appearance of symptoms that are characteristic of catatonia and cause significant impairment or distress in occupational, social, or other important areas of an individual’s life. The essential features of the primary mental disorder or other medical condition are not clear. Furthermore, the full criteria for catatonia as indicated in the DSM-5 are not met, and there is not sufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).


The clinical treatment of catatonic symptoms involved medication management and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Antipsychotics are effective in treating symptoms of catatonia. However, there are concerns with these medications since they can cause or worsen catatonia in some individuals. Still, because they are effective with most individuals with these disorders, they continue to be used. ECT is another form of treatment for catatonia. It involves administering electric shock to the brain, which precipitates a seizure in order to quickly reverse symptoms of catatonia. If an individual does not positively react to medication therapy, ECT has been shown to be the second choice of treatment. ECT has been found to be an effective and safe treatment approach.


Celexa is a prescription antidepressant medication for the treatment of depression and various anxiety disorders. Its generic name is citalopram.


Celexa is one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Its main use is for the treatment of depression. Other uses include treatment of alcoholism, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter or brain chemical that carries nerve impulses from one nerve cell to another. It is believed that depression and certain mental disorders are caused by insufficient serotonin in the brain. Like the other SSRI antidepressants, Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil, Celexa increases the level of brain serotonin. Increased serotonin levels in the brain appear to be beneficial in relieving symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, alcoholism, headaches, and premenstrual tension and mood swings.


Individuals who are allergic to other SSRI medications should not be prescribed Celexa. Those with liver problems and those over the age of 65 are best treated with lower doses of the drug. Those with histories of mania, suicide attempts, or seizure disorders should start Celexa with caution and only under close physician supervision. Children and young adults are at higher risk of developing suicidal thoughts and actions. Generally, those under 18 years of age should not take Celexa. Because it interacts with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, like Parnate, an antidepressant, or Buspirone, an antianxiety medication, Celexa should not be used in combination with these medications. Similarly, certain herbal supplements, like Ginkgo and St. John’s wort, should not be taken together with Celexa.
   Nausea, dry mouth, and insomnia are among the most common side effect of Celexa. Other side effects include anxiety, agitation, headaches, dizziness, restlessness, sedation, tremor, and yawning. Decreased sex drive in women and difficulty ejaculating in men have been reported, while weight gain or loss is not common. In some patients these sexual side effects never resolve. If sexual side effects continue, the dose may be reduced or a switch made to another antidepressant.





Certified Addictions Professional is a credential for individuals who provide treatment services for addictions. It is also known as CAP.


• Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain that involves compulsive and uncontrolled pursuit of reward or relief with substance use or other compulsive behaviors.
• Alcoholism is a general term for the compulsive and uncontrolled consumption of alcohol to the detriment of the drinker’s health, relationships, and social standing.
• Ambivalence is a human phenomenon that occurs when a client has opposing opinions about behavioral change.
• Case management is a process that involves linking clients to community resources that may enhance or promote their well-being or daily functioning.
• DSM-5 is the abbreviation for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders.
• Motivational interviewing is a counseling approach that is used to assist individuals


in considering behavioral change, that is, to stop using alcohol and seek alternative coping strategies.

• Substance-related and addictive disorders are a group of DSM-5 mental disorders that include substance disorders characterized by physiological dependence, drug-seeking behavior, tolerance, and social withdrawal. This group also includes the non-substance disorder of gambling.


Certified Addictions Professional (CAP) is a credential that requires training, supervision, and passing a standardized exam. This designation allows clinicians to provide assessment and treatment among individuals living with substance-related and addictive disorders. Individuals with this credential are certified through their state’s addictions certification board. This certification requires a minimum of a bachelor’s degree and specific education in addictions. Other requirements include supervised work experience with substance abusers and passing a state certification exam. Specific training is required in the following areas: clinical evaluation, case management, counseling, treatment planning, professional documentation, ethical and professional issues, theory and treatment of addictions, client and community education, and application to practice. Training in these content areas can be obtained online or in face-to-face training settings.
Certified Addictions Professionals provide assessment and psychotherapeutic treatment, create treatment plans, and provide case management to individuals living with substance use disorders. Services that CAPs offer include addiction prevention, intervention, and continuing care services. Specific interventions include substance abuse counseling among individuals, couples, families, communities, and group therapy contexts. Substance abuse counseling includes talk therapy interventions such as relapse prevention, learning new coping skills, learning triggers, and cognitive and behavioral replacement strategies. CAPs are trained in working with clients who





may be court ordered for treatment or who are not motivated to stop using substances.
   Since many clients who enter drug treatment are ambivalent about changing, motivational interviewing is often used. It can assist clients in examining their behaviors and ambivalence in a nonjudgmental and supportive environment. CAPs often utilize this approach to form an alliance with the client but also assist the client in resolving his or her ambivalence about abstaining from substance use and eventually assist him or her in committing to therapy and self-improvement.
   Maintenance of the CAP credential requires ongoing continuing education that can be attained from approved providers. Continuing education is required to ensure that clinicians are learning and practicing empirically supported treatments. CAP holders are responsible for obtaining required continuing education through approved or accredited training providers.
   The CAP credential is affiliated with the International Certification & Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC), which monitors the international standards of practice in addiction counseling and other tasks that CAPs engage in. In addition, the IC&RC recognizes the minimum standards to provide reciprocity to professors across state borders. The certification board monitors the code of ethics to ensure quality assurance in the prevention and treatment of individuals living with addictions. Individuals applying for the CAP also take an international exam from the IC&RC.
Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC)

A Certified Rehabilitation Counselor is a professionally trained therapist who works to help people with various disabilities. It is also known as a CRC.


• Certification is a formal procedure by which an accredited or authorized person or agency assesses and verifies that a person has the knowledge and skills to perform certain activities.
• Rehabilitation counseling is a type of counseling that focuses on helping individuals who have disabilities in order to achieve their career, personal, and independent living goals.


Specific qualifications are required in order to become a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC). This includes specialized education, training, and field work prior to passing a national exam. Once a person successfully completes these steps, he or she is able to apply to become a CRC. The education and training that CRCs receive focus on understanding the medical and psychosocial aspects of various disabilities.
   Those students seeking a master’s degree in rehabilitation counseling have undergraduate degrees in rehabilitation services, psychology, sociology, or other human services–related fields. As a master’s degree is required at a minimum, rehabilitation counselors are trained at the graduate level. Most earn a master’s degree, with a few continuing on to the doctoral level. The Council on Rehabilitation Education accredits programs at universities, but not all programs meet accreditation requirements. This limitation prohibits some graduates from professional certification/licensure.
   The primary purpose of rehabilitation counselors is to value a client’s rights to be as independent as possible. This includes independent living, promoting advocacy, and empowering the client to be socially included. There are several areas of specialty among





rehabilitation counselors. These include specializations in employee assistance, job coaching, substance abuse, life and medical care planning, and mental health counseling. CRCs should also be knowledgeable about assistive technology and devices that can help people overcome obstacles. A CRC is also involved in case management and assessing a client’s abilities and strengths to help him or her get jobs.


Although policies vary from state to state, rehabilitation counselors who work in the federal and state systems typically must hold a master’s degree in rehabilitation counseling, special education, or a related field, and are required to be certified or be eligible to sit for the certification examination. People accepting employment in government-run vocational rehabilitation programs are required to meet these qualifications by a specific date in order to keep their jobs.

Chamomile


in prepackaged tea bags, in capsule form, as an oil, and as a liquid extract. Chamomile has both internal and external use. It has been used internally for a wide variety of conditions to remove intestinal parasites, to prevent or to reduce inflammation, and to control infection. Chamomile has also been used to relieve intestinal cramping, digestive disorders, menstrual cramps, premenstrual syndrome, headache, and other stress-related disorders. In addition, it is used a sedative, often in the form of tea, to treat anxiety and insomnia. External uses of chamomile include blending its oil with lavender or rose for scenting perfumes, candles, creams, and for other aromatherapy products intended to calm or relax the user’s mind and body and reduce anxiety.
   Does chamomile actually work? A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found chamomile extract helped reduce symptoms of mild to moderate generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Because this is the first controlled clinical trial of chamomile extract for GAD and involved a small sample, additional studies are needed to support its findings. Unlike prescription medications, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not evaluate chamomile with regard to its effectiveness, purity, or safety.


Generally, chamomile is considered safe. However, it can cause side effects such as allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to ragweed and other substances. Chamomile should not be taken two weeks before or after surgery. Women who are pregnant or could become pregnant should not use chamomile, since its use may increase the risk of miscarriage. Similarly, it should not be used by mothers who are breast-feeding infants. Chamomile can increase the effects of anticoagulant medications and the effects of

Chamomile is an herb that has been used to alleviate anxiety and stress, to produce mild sedation, to reduce restlessness and irritability, and to ease depression.


The chamomile flower has been harvested for centuries for various medicinal purposes. Today, various preparations are available. It is commercially available

benzodiazepines. It could also adversely interact with sedatives, antiplatelet drugs, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Individuals prescribed such medications should talk with their doctor before using chamomile. In addition, chamomile can interact with supplements such as ginkgo biloba, garlic, saw palmetto, St. John’s wort, and valerian.








Chicken Soup for the Soul is a New York Times best-selling book that was first released on June 28, 1993. Since this first publication, 200 variations on the title and translations into 40 different languages have followed. Over 112 million copies have been sold in the United States and Canada alone.


The popular book series, Chicken Soup for the Soul, written by Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield, has seen much success grossing over $2 billion to date. The authors both had previous careers as motivational speakers and knew how storytelling could be used to inspire others. For the original book, published in 1993, they gathered 101 of the most powerful stories from ordinary people all over the nation. The book’s title came from Canfield’s memory of his grandmother and how she always said that her chicken soup could cure any ailment; they applied this same concept to hurts of the soul.
   Chicken Soup for the Soul did not gain initial popularity from media attention but rather through simple word of mouth. By September 1994, it was on every major best-seller list in the United States and Canada. It soon received coverage on television shows like The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Today Show and major sitcoms such as Friends and Everybody Loves Raymond. In 1995, the book won the prestigious American Booksellers’ Book of the Year Award. In 1996, it was honored Non-Fiction Literacy Award by the American Family Institute. Chicken Soup for the Soul set a record in 1998 when it had seven books from the series on the New York Times best-seller list at one time.



The next two decades saw continued growth for the brand. In 2007, USA Today honored Chicken Soup for the Soul as one of the five most memorable and affecting books in the last quarter century. In April 2008, the authors sold a large portion of the company to a multimedia group headed by Internet executive, Bill Rouhana, hoping to expand the book’s impact further. The newest titles in the series are now distributed through Simon & Schuster, Inc. Over 112 million books have been sold to date, and titles have been translated into more than 40 languages. The Chicken Soup for the Soul name is one of the most well known; 88.7% of people recognize it and know what it is (Harris Poll). The company is hoping to expand into other media outlets and is currently working on the development of television shows and Internet sites devoted to providing people with comfort, support, and overall wellness.




Child abuse and neglect impacts more children in the United States than all other serious diseases. Every year more than 3 million reports of child abuse that involve more than 6 million children are made in the United States. According to the nonprofit organization Child Help, there is a report of child abuse approximately every 10 seconds, and according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), more than four children die every day as a result of abuse.

The Centers for Disease Control defines “child abuse” as the physical, sexual, or emotional maltreatment or neglect of a child or children. It includes any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.





   Child abuse can occur in multiple different forms of either physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or neglect. Neglect can be physical, educational, emotional, or medical. Physical neglect includes abandonment or lack of supervision as well as failure to provide for the child’s safety or physical needs. Educational neglect includes not enrolling the child in school or allowing for frequent truancy. Emotional neglect includes a lack of affection or attention or psychological care for a child’s needs. Medical neglect includes delay or withholding medical care, including due to religious beliefs. However, not all states will prosecute in relation to religious beliefs.
   Indicators of neglect can include poor hygiene, unsuitable clothing, untreated injury, lack of immunizations, and indicators of prolonged exposure to elements such as extreme heat or cold as well as height and weight significantly below healthy age levels.
   Physical abuse is generally the most obvious form of abuse as there can be marks left on the child. This could include everything from punching, beating, burning to shaking of a baby or child. Indicators of physical abuse are recurrent injuries that have either unexplained or inconsistent explanations. The child may be hesitant to show certain parts of his or her body, for instance, not wanting to dress out for physical education classes. The child may also act out aggressively toward others.
   Fetal abuse is the result of the parent consuming drugs or alcohol while pregnant. This can result in the child being born addicted. It can also result in premature birth, miscarriage, or developmental delays.
   Sexual abuse involves a child in sexual activities. There can be non-touching sexual abuse, which would include an adult exposing himself or herself to the child. Touching sexual abuse would include fondling, making the child touch an adult's sexual organs, or penetration of a child by adult or object. Sexual exploitation includes using the child for prostitution or for pornography. Indicators of sexual abuse include sexually acting out, bruises or bleeding in the genitalia, bed-wetting, excessive bathing, fire setting, aggressive or withdrawn behaviors, or substance abuse. Child sexual abuse is for the benefit of the abuser with lack of regard for the child. Ninety percent of child sexual abuse cases go unreported due to the child being afraid to tell anyone what happened.


   Emotional abuse can greatly negatively impact a child’s development and self-concept. This is generally the hardest to identify due to lack of physical evidence. This can be done by rejecting the child and humiliating or shaming the child, as well as isolating the child. Indicators of emotional abuse can be seen by the child hiding his or her eyes or avoiding eye contact as well as defensiveness, low self-esteem, regression, difficulty with relationships, depression, or alcohol and drug use. Children at risk for abuse can come from a family where violence within the intimate partners is present, or are younger than four years. Another risk factor comes from living in communities with high level of violence or in families with great stress, substance abuse, poverty, or chronic illness. However, abuse can happen anywhere. The perpetrator generally has low
levels of empathy and low levels of self-esteem.

Each year in the United States more than 3 million reports of child abuse involving over 6 million children are made. Each state in the country has a state-run department that investigates these reports and takes actions to help protect and assist in maintaining and assuring family safety. Regardless of the type of abuse, mental health symptoms such as depression or aggression are common after experiencing a form of abuse.
   Research has shown that with a history of sexual abuse in childhood there are a multitude of mental health and behavioral problems in adult life. There is generally a strong link with depressive symptoms as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. Adults with drug and/or alcohol addiction also demonstrate high frequencies of reports of sexual abuse in their childhood. In fact adults with a history of childhood sexual abuse have significantly higher rates of an axis 1 disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV-TR).
   Child abuse clearly can have long-lasting effects on development of children causing emotional difficulties and aggressive behaviors. There is also strong evidence that children who have been abused or neglected struggle with social relationships and interactions with peers. Children who have been abused or neglected are





also at increased risk for juvenile delinquency, substance abuse, and self-destructive behaviors.




It usually begins at an early age and lasts throughout someone’s life to some degree. This condition disrupts the sounds produced from a child and creates a stutter. At some point in time, almost everyone experiences difficulty communicating. In child onset fluency disorder, a child’s speech is significantly challenged and creates problems in daily communication.
   These problems in daily communication can impact a child’s ability to communicate under stressful circumstances. For example, if the home or classroom is a stressful environment, a child will have more disruptions in speech. This can occur commonly when talking on the telephone or in public speaking when speech is relied on heavily for effective communication. For some children their stuttering can occur across environments and situations. This can cause isolation and removal from certain activities that children want to be involved with. Many children with this condition will try to hide their speech problems by using words they can rely on using well or by claiming to forget what they were trying to say or simply my remaining silent.
   Child onset fluency disorder usually presents itself around the age of two to four years. In some cases, stuttering will start during later elementary school years but this is rare. It is more common for males to be diagnosed with this condition. Young children who are diagnosed are usually not aware of their speech problems. But children develop, they become aware that
they are different from others and notice other people’s

Child onset fluency disorder is a condition that disrupts a child’s speech. It is also called stuttering.

• Fluency is the ability to speak correctly and easily.
• Stuttering is talking with continued involuntary repetition of sounds, especially initial consonants.



Child onset fluency disorder affects how fluently a child speaks and is therefore understood by others.

reactions to their speech.
   There are different levels of stuttering that vary across the children who are diagnosed. For some children, speech problems are significant and can persist for days, weeks, and months. Some other children will develop minor speech issues and improve fairly quickly from the first signs of stuttering. Child onset fluency disorder can also improve under certain circumstances and vary daily. This can make it seem like the condition goes away completely and then reappears later. When a child becomes a teenager and later an adult, his or her speech issues tend to stabilize and does not tend to get better or worse with age although under stressful circumstances stuttering tends to worsen.






The cause of child onset fluency disorder is not known. Research suggests that genetics influences a child’s likelihood to be diagnosed with the disorder. When family members inherit stuttering from their family, it directly impacts their ability to speak fluently. But not everyone who is genetically prone to the condition will develop it.
   For many people diagnosed with stuttering, stressful life events can often initiate their speech problems. When children are young, their speech issues might be creating more mature sentences. This can occur when a child is attempting to develop from two or three word sentences into longer, more complicated statements. Therefore, it may appear that a child does not stutter when he or she uses fewer words and then later speech problems appear. A child who is frustrated by speech is more likely to become physically tense, and this can affect the child’s ease of communicating. Other children can make fun of their peers, and this can worsen the symptoms of stuttering. Many diagnosed with this condition experience feelings of anxiety and shame.
   Symptoms of the disorder are repeating words or parts of words in addition to lengthening words. Children and adults with the condition might appear to be nervous or out of breath. People with the disorder make a serious effort to complete a word and try not to get stuck on words.


The accurate diagnosis of child onset fluency disorder should be done by an evaluation by a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). It might seem easy for others to identify stuttering in some, but not easy in others. SLPs will be able to identify the types of issues that a child presents with and can identify stressors in the environment that impact the speech disorder. Formal assessments, observations, and parent or teacher interviews are typically used during diagnosis and interpreted by the SLP.
   After a comprehensive assessment, the results should include when stuttering is most likely to occur. There are specific pieces of information that are


important to consider including family history, if the speech problems have occurred for at least six months and if the child is concerned or scared of speaking. When these characteristics are present, a diagnosis of child onset fluency disorder is probably appropriate.
   Over half of the children diagnosed between two and four years who stutter will improve and no longer have speech problems. Usually this occurs within a few months of the diagnosis. For others, stuttering will last for years and have periods of supposed improvements with some periods of regression. It is unclear why some children continue stuttering while others do not. Most children who recover from the condition have received speech therapy, but there are some who never receive treatment and also recover. More research needs to be done on this to help determine what helps children become more fluent.


Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are involved in the delivery of speech therapy for children who are diagnosed with stuttering. Many treatment programs are behavioral in nature and focus on teaching the person new skills to improve speech. SLPs who treat these clients use techniques such as monitoring speech pace and relaxation. Learning to control the rate or pace of speech is one of the most effective methods for managing stuttering. This helps people speak more easily and fluidly over time and can create more natural language development and fluency.
   Treatment of children during their preschool years is controversial for some SLPs. This is because it is hard to determine whether some children outgrow their issues and many are concerned that treatment could bring damaging awareness to a child who is not able to cope well. In order to prevent this, therapists will recommend a wait-and-see approach in order to give the child time to develop and improve on his or her own. If after a determined period of time therapists, teachers, and parents do not see improvements, individual therapy is warranted.
   Parents and other caregivers who are able to interact with children can model fluent speech. Involving the parents and teachers whom the child is exposed to the most has proven helpful in eliminating symptoms





in young children. The use of devices and technology has also shown to help children with speech issues. One such way these devices can be used is by recording fluent speech from the child and playing this back to the child.
   Support and treatment groups for people with stuttering issues are widely available. These groups are usually self-help in nature and bring together groups of people who face the same problem. People who participate in support groups claim that their experiences in the group give them an opportunity to use techniques they’ve learned in therapy. They can help each other cope with everyday problems and serve as support. Many of these groups exist in the United States and the world.




“Child Protective Services” (CPS) is the name, in many states, of the governmental agency that is responsible for responding to and investigating reports of child abuse and/or neglect. Other states have similar agencies but use other names.


Child Protective Services is a state agency partly funded by the federal government and partly by state and local sources, which handles reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Each state has its own laws that define abuse and neglect, obligations for reporting, protocol to follow, and penalties for abusers. State agencies receive guidance and structure from the national agency, the Administration for Children and Families, also referred to as the Children’s Bureau, which falls


under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Depending on the state, the child protective services agency may also be known as the Department of Children and Families, the Department of Children and Family Services, or the Department of Social Services. As the name denotes, the main objectives of this department are to ensure the welfare of minors and provide social services to families. The agency is responsible for a wide range of services, including assisting families with proper care and safety in order to remain together, foster care placement, youth and young adult transition programs out of foster care, and adoption procedures. Personnel work in conjunction with community agencies, tribes, schools, local law enforcement, and the courts.
   The law prohibits child maltreatment and Child Protective Services (CPS) may respond to abusive acts by forcefully removing the child from an unsafe home. Any person who suspects child abuse or neglect should promptly report it to CPS. As of August 2012, approximately 18 states and Puerto Rico have issued statutes that require this. Several professionals are classified as “mandatory reporters” including doctors, teachers, and childcare providers, and they are responsible for most of the reports made. Once a report is made, CPS staff may initiate an investigation to determine if the child is at risk and whether the environment is safe for the child to remain in. Initial calls are either “screened out” or “screened in” depending on whether there is sufficient information to warrant an investigation. If a report is screened out, the CPS staff member may refer the reporter to other local agencies or to local law enforcement for help. However, if the report is screened in, then the CPS caseworker must respond to the report in a timely manner, anywhere from a few hours to a few days. This depends on the information provided, including the type of abuse, potential severity of the situation, and the requirements under state law. An investigation will include questioning of the child, the child’s parents/guardians, and other people who are in regular contact with the child. If the child is believed to be in imminent danger, then he or she may be removed from the home immediately and placed in the care of a relative or friend or in foster care while court proceedings take place. Depending on the state, additional steps may also be taken to help remediate and support





the family in order for them to reconcile. Once the investigation is complete, the CPS caseworker makes one of two findings, either unsubstantiated (unfounded) or substantiated (founded). If unsubstantiated, then the case is filed and essentially dropped; if substantiated, the CPS agency then initiates the authority of the court to determine what actions, if any, are necessary to keep the child safe. The court may then issue order to place the child in the care of another entity, require services be sought, or order that the abuser have no contact with the child. CPS claims that its preferred course of action is to rehabilitate and reunite families; however, this is often not the case. Evidence has also shown that disregard for following proper protocol, delay in the timeliness of responding to reports, and lack of communication between members has contributed to negative perceptions of CPS.
   Dating back to 1825, states began enacting laws giving child welfare agencies the authority to remove abused and neglected children from their homes and place them in proper care. In 1874, the first case of child abuse to be prosecuted in the United States, referred to as “the case of Mary Ellen,” spurred public outrage and subsequent response from the federal government, including President Roosevelt’s public funding of volunteer organizations dedicated to child welfare. The Children’s Bureau was established in 1912 by President Taft to coordinate efforts on a national level. The Social Security Act of 1930 outlined further funding toward child maltreatment intervention. C. Henry Kempe referred to “battered child syndrome” in articles published in 1961–1962, raising concerns over the long-lasting effects of abuse. This led to 49 states passing mandatory child abuse reporting laws by the mid-1960s. In 1974, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) was passed bringing further national attention to the issue. In addition to providing federal funding toward prevention efforts and treatment, the CAPTA supported research and data collection activities. The CAPTA was recently amended and reauthorized on December 10, 2010. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-272), considered the first piece of comprehensive legislation on the problem, promoted state economic incentives for decreasing the length and number of minors placed in foster care. Other similar


legislation followed, including the Adoption Assistance Act, the Child Abuse Prevention, Adoption, and Family Services Act of 1988, and the Child Abuse, Domestic Violence, Adoption, and Family Services Act of 1992. All focused on easing the adoption process to promote family permanency for children. In 1997, the Adoption and Safe Families Act was passed, introducing the idea of “concurrent planning” where casework-ers first attempt to reunify families but, in conjunction, work an alternative plan so as not to delay permanency for the child. Current practice is based on this model.

Child abuse and neglect remains a public concern. According to a 2010 report issued by the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, a nationally estimated 754,000 duplicate (repeated victims) and 695,000 unique (first-time reports) number of children were found to be victims of child maltreatment. Based on the unique number of victims, an estimated 78% suffered neglect, 18% were physically abused, 9% were sexually abused, 8% were psychologically abused, and 2% were medically neglected. Recent statistics issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2012 reported that an overwhelming 676,569 children were victims of abuse or neglect (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2013). Victims of childhood maltreatment suffer from physical, emotional, and psychological distress and are more prone to develop depression, anxiety, and social and behavioral problems. Of further concern are incidents of recidivism, as the cycle of abuse is likely to repeat itself. Prevention efforts should focus on counseling; skill development and remediation; and practical support for victims, perpetrators, and their families.








Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) is a condition where after healthy development up to the age of approximately 2 but before a child turns 10 years of age, there is loss in many areas of functioning.


Childhood disintegrative disorder, also known as Hell-er’s syndrome, is often considered part of a larger category of developmental disorders. The latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual places it clearly within the definition of autism spectrum disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However, unlike others who exhibit autism, those with CDD show severe and abrupt regression following several years of normal development. It is characterized as a more dramatic loss of skills than in other children, and many develop the disorder later than is typical with autism. History and data on this condition is limited, and it may often be misdiagnosed. From the data collected, it seems that the condition occurs in only 2 out of 100,000 children and that most are boys.


In the absence of brain injury or trauma, science has not determined the characteristic causes for CDD. It is difficult to determine why some children who had previously been on a normal developmental curve begin to lose skills and abilities that they had already acquired. Some research suggests that a combination of genetic issues, including autoimmune factors, and prenatal and environmental stress may explain brain differences for those with CDD. Some scientists have discovered higher-than-normal protein deposits in the brain that can disrupt synaptic transmission.
   Symptoms are varied but distinct. In studies at the Yale Child Study Center, it is noted that children with CDD tend to undergo rapid and severe regression. In addition to loss of skills, 70% of these children have episodes of behavior problems before regression. For children between the ages of three and four, some other symptoms of the possible presence of CDD may be increased activity, irritability, or anxiety, which precedes a marked decrease or loss in speaking ability, social skills, and/or motor skills. These motor issues include bladder and/or bowel control problems. Additional symptoms may include difficulty in making the transition from sleep to waking, poor social interactions, tantrums, or withdrawal from peers, as well as poor coordination and awkwardness in walking.


It is important to note that although some children go through periods of limited regression during normal development, these temporary setbacks are not long lasting. These do not match the severity or lasting impact of the deficits that mark CDD. CDD is characterized by sharp, significant, and often permanent losses of abilities. Although some symptoms may parallel those that occur in autism spectrum disorder and Rett’s disorder, clinical analysis will help determine whether the symptoms actually indicate that CDD is the proper diagnosis. In most cases of CDD, the loss of skills reaches a plateau, which unfortunately may last a lifetime. There are some cases when the loss of skills is progressive and leads to early death.





There are no medications specific for CDD, although individual symptoms may be addressed with drugs. Therapeutic behavioral interventions are commonly used, such as applied behavior analysis. This treatment is an attempt to slow down the child’s deterioration and help stabilize and improve the child’s communication, self-help, and social skills.


The Children’s Apperception Test (CAT) is a projective test used to assess personality traits, maturity level, and overall psychological well-being in children 3 to 10 years of age.


• Apperception is the process of understanding something through associating it with a previous experience.
• Projective test is a type of psychological assessment that seeks to assess a person’s true feelings, thoughts, and attitudes based on responses to ambiguous stimuli.
• Rorschach test, also known as the “Inkblot Test,” was developed by Hermann Rorschach in 1921 and is the most widely used psychological projective assessment. Respondents,


ages three and up, are shown a series of inkblot cards and asked a series of questions in order to reveal information about their personality, preferences, and possible internal/external conflicts.



The Children’s Apperception Test is a projective personality test for children. Sigmund Freud used the term “projection” to describe how a person may unconsciously project his or her inner feelings onto the external world and vice versa. Projective assessment tools are used to encourage one to openly express what one thinks and feels. General impressions and insights are derived about the person from the answers given. Another commonly used projective assessment is the Rorschach Inkblot test.
   The CAT is based on the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), which was created by psychologist Henry
A. Murray for use with people aged 10 years and older. The TAT is comprised of a series of 31 picture cards depicting humans in common social and relational situations. Respondents are asked to develop their own stories based on the scenes on the cards. Answers are believed to reveal underlying themes, emotions, and conflicts about the person’s inner world and interpersonal relationships. The CAT follows the same process of assessment as the TAT but is meant to be used with children under the age of ten. The child is presented a series of picture cards and asked to describe what’s happening in the situations to the examiner. When this test is used correctly, it is believed to reveal significant aspects of a child’s personality. There are three versions of the CAT: the CAT-A (pictures of animals), the CAT-H (pictures of humans), and the CAT-S (pictures of children in typical family situations). Administration of the CAT takes approximately 20 to 45 minutes. However, there is no set time limit. There are no right or wrong answers, and no numerical score are given on the CAT.




 the

CAT-S, was also added, which included pictures of children in typical family situations. The most recent version of the CAT was published in 1993. Again, the purpose of these tests was to elicit personal identification with what was happening in the picture card scenes.

Current Status and Results
The CAT should be administered only by a trained professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed counselor, social worker, or teacher with specific training in this type of assessment). The results of the CAT alone should never be used to diagnose. Rather, it should be given as part of a larger battery of tests and include an in-depth interview with both the child and his or her parents/guardians. A thorough medical history should also be obtained. This way the assessor has a comprehensive picture of the child’s overall psychological functioning.
   The Children’s Apperception Test is not considered a reliable or valid assessment. There is no clear evidence to support that this test measures what it seeks to or that it measures those constructs consistently from child to child. In addition, because this is a subjective type of assessment based mostly on the opinions and impressions of the examiner, findings are subject to bias and error.


The Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) is an assessment that is used to evaluate the symptoms of depression in children and adolescents.

• Depression is an emotional state characterized by feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, guilt, or reduced ability to enjoy life. It is not considered a mental disorder unless it significantly disrupts one’s daily functioning.


In its long form the CDI is a list of 27 questions that rates the symptoms of depression in children and teens aged 7 to 17. It measures five different factors. Those are negative mood, self-esteem, interpersonal problems, lack of pleasure, and ineffectiveness. This instrument or tool has a revised version that provides an option for teachers and parents to rate the children they have or are working with.
   The CDI is also available in a short, 10-question format. Today, it is highly recommended that the long-form CDI be used, which includes sections for teachers and parents. When CDI results are combined with adult observation and input, they can help provide an accurate description of the child’s situation. It helps with early identification of depression and getting treatment to those who need it as quickly as possible.

Children can experience mood swings as they develop. But some children suffer from true clinical depression which can be dangerous since self-harm and suicide are possible results. During the 1970s and 1980s childhood depression started to be recognized, and several instruments like the CDI were created.





   Maria Kovacs, PhD, was the developer of the CDI. Dr. Kovacs began practicing cognitive therapy in the 1970s as a treatment that was effective for depression, even more so than traditional drugs. For many years Dr. Kovacs worked with Aaron T. Beck, MD, who developed a popular depression inventory instrument, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI was created for adults and based on Dr. Beck’s clinical experience with depressed patients. Dr. Kovacs collaborated with him to research and develop the CDI, which was published in 1979.

Since it was first published, the CDI has been used in the United States and internationally as a way to identify depression in children and adolescents. The CDI has been validated statistically as a predictor of depressive disorders in children. It is also used to show a distinction between its results for depression and anxiety disorder or conduct disorders.
   The CDI does face some criticism as an accurate instrument. One is that it provides too many false negatives, which means that the test shows no depression when depression really exists. Another is that it may identify children who have a general emotional disturbance rather than depression.



Chronic illness is the subjective experience of a chronic disease.



• Acute disease is a medical condition with a single cause, a specific onset, and identifiable symptoms which is often treatable with medication or surgery and is usually curable.
• Chronic disease is a disease entity that usually does not have a single cause, a specific onset, nor a stable set of symptoms. While cure may be possible, it is unlikely for advanced levels of the disease process. It is also referred to as chronic medical conditions.
• Disease is an objective medical condition that can be acute or chronic.
• Illness is the subjective experience of a disease.
• Well-being is the state of being happy, healthy, prosperous, or successful.



Chronic diseases are medical conditions that are prolonged in duration and do not resolve spontaneously. They are seldom cured completely. Common examples are heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and arthritis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers chronic diseases to be the most common and costly of all health problems. Nearly 50% of American adults (133 million) live with at least one chronic disease. They account for 70% of all deaths. These diseases account for more than 75% of health-care costs. Chronic medical conditions are three types more common than psychiatric conditions. The reality is that they are preventable. CDC points to four modifiable health behaviors that are responsible for most disability and premature deaths related to chronic diseases. These are tobacco use, inadequate physical activity, poor food choices, and overuse of alcohol. With the average life span now extending in the 80s, the reality is that most individuals can expect to contend with chronic illness in themselves or in the lives of those close to them.
While many use the terms chronic disease and
chronic illness interchangeably, they have somewhat different meanings. While disease represents an objective process, illness is a subjective process. As such,





chronic illness is experienced differently from individual to individual. Unfortunately, the health-care system has let to offer those with chronic diseases in contrast to those with acute diseases. Largely, this is because medical research and the training of health-care providers has emphasized acute diseases. Furthermore, for treatment to be effective, providers must be sufficiently competent in tailoring treatment that is responsive to multiple factors. These include the individual’s unique personality, coping resources, culture, and the type and phase of his or her illness.
   There are four main types of chronic diseases. The first is the life-threatening medical conditions such as fast-growing cancers, stroke, and heart attacks. A second type includes the manageable medical conditions such type 2 diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, and chronic sinusitis. While they may become serious, they are seldom life threatening. The third type includes progressively disabling diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. The fourth type includes those that are not life threatening but have a waxing and waning course. Sometimes, but not always, this type can be debilitating. Chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia are examples.
   There are also four phases of chronic illness. These have been described by Patricia Fennell (2003). They are based on her clinical research with several hundred individuals with various types of chronic medical conditions.
   Phase One: Crisis. The basic task of this phase is to deal with the immediate symptoms, pain, or traumas associated with this new experience of illness.
   Phase Two: Stabilization. The basic task of this phase is to stabilize and restructure life patterns and perceptions.
   Phase Three: Resolution. The basic task of this phase is to develop a new self and to seek a personally meaningful philosophy of life and spirituality consistent with it.
   Phase Four: Integration. The basic task of this phase is to achieve the highest level of well-being possible despite compromised or failing health status.
   It should be noted that not all individuals with a chronic illness proceed through all four phases. In fact, many chronically ill individuals get caught in a recurring loop of cycling between phase one and phase two.


This means that each crisis produces new wounding and destabilization. Such crises are likely to be followed by a brief period of stabilization. But without intervention, a new crises will invariably destabilize the individual again. Only when health providers help these chronically ill individuals to break this recurring cycle can they move to phases three and four.



Chronic pain syndrome is a medical condition characterized by the experience of long-standing pain. It is also known as chronic pain.


• Acute pain is pain that comes on quickly and may be severe but is experienced for a relatively short time (less than six months). It is the opposite of chronic pain.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Fibromyalgia is a medical condition characterized by widespread, unexplained pain as well as sensitivity to pressure or touch in specific areas of the body.





• ICD-10 stands for the International Statistical Classification and Related Health Problems, 10th edition. It is published by the World Health Organization and lists all known medical and psychological conditions affecting human beings worldwide.
• Mindfulness-based stress reduction is a form of cognitive behavior therapy that utilizes meditation and yoga to change the way an individual perceives and reacts to bodily sensations.
• Mindfulness practices are intentional activities that foster living in the present moment and awareness that is nonjudgmental and accepting.
• Pain is an unpleasant sensation occurring in varying degrees of severity as a result of injury, disease, or emotional distress.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Rheumatology is the field of medicine concerned with the painful disorders of the skin, joints, nerves, and bones.

“Chronic pain syndrome” is a general term and medical condition. In contrast to acute pain, it does not disappear when the underlying cause of pain has been treated or has healed. Chronic pain lasts longer than six months. It is described in the ICD-10 as the experience of ongoing pain that may or may not have a known physiological (related to the body) cause. There is no specific set of symptoms that accurately describes all individuals who suffer from chronic pain syndrome. Symptoms may include dull back pain, severe headaches, and widespread painful sensation of the skin layer. One of the most widely known forms of chronic pain syndrome is fibromyalgia. Although fibromyalgia is considered to be a specific medical diagnosis, the cause is still unknown. Chronic pain syndrome is not described in the DSM-5. There is no agreement as to what causes chronic pain syndrome. Although this condition is poorly understood,


it is relatively common. Estimates of the occurrence of this disorder exceed 25% of U.S. population.


Chronic pain syndrome is treated differently depending on the types of symptoms described by the individual as well as the type of clinician seen. Common treatment may include over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Advil (ibuprofen) or Aleve (naproxen-sodium). Corticosteroid injections and narcotic pain medications may also be prescribed by a physician, often one specializing in rheumatology. Although this condition is considered to be physiological in nature, certain forms of psychotherapy have been shown to be effective in reducing pain. The forms of psychotherapy that are most notable are those that involve mindfulness practice such as mindfulness-based stress reduction. Unfortunately, there are no known treatments considered to be completely curative.


Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorder is a mental disorder that is characterized by irregular patterns of sleep.






• Behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors.
• Circadian rhythm is the approximately 24-hour cycle of physiological and psychological regulation of bodily rhythms such as sleeping and waking. It is commonly referred to as the “internal bodily clock.”
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Light therapy is a medical treatment in which doses of bright light are administered to normalize the body’s internal clock and treat depression. It is also called phototherapy.
• Sleep hygiene refers to the habits, practices, and nonmedical treatments for insomnia, which improve the quality of sleep.
• Sleep–wake disorders are a group of mental disorders that are characterized by various sleeping disturbances including circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorder.

Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorder is one of the Sleep–Wake Disorders in DSM-5. It is characterized by a sleep pattern that is out of sync with normal circadian rhythms. Individuals with this disorder have trouble sleeping during the times that others typically sleep. Those with this disorder may not follow the typical circadian rhythms of others, but if allowed to follow their particular patterns, they can experience sufficient and otherwise normal sleep.
   To be diagnosed with this disorder, the individual must have recurrent difficulty adapting sleeping patterns to his or her environmental requirements such as job or social demands. In addition, the incongruence of his or her sleeping pattern with these demands must cause sleeplessness, sleepiness, or both. Individuals


may be genetically predisposed to this disorder. Also, atypical light exposure (such as living in northern climates where there is limited daylight) may also be a contributing factor.
   DSM-5 identifies five subtypes of circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorder. A brief description of each follows:
Delayed sleep phase type. The delay sleep phase
type is characterized by the inability to fall asleep for at least two hours after the preferred sleep time. Individuals with this disorder may also have difficulty waking at the preferred time as a result of a short sleep period. Consequently, individuals may experience sleepiness throughout the day, especially in the morning. Although this disorder affects approximately 17% of the adult population, it is common in adolescence where upward of 7% may experience this type. This diagnosis in adolescence is differentiated from normal sleeping pattern difficulty in that the symptoms typically persist for greater than three months (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Without treatment, some may experience this disorder intermittently for their entire lives, while for others, symptoms are reduced with age.
Advanced sleep phase type. This type is characterized by earlier than normal sleep–wake times, typically of at least two hours. Also, if an individual delays sleep until the conventional time, he or she will still wake early, thereby causing excessive daytime sleepiness. This type affects approximately 1% of the adult population. Although onset can occur at any age, it is more common in middle-aged and older adults (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). It is important to note that advanced sleep times are common in older adults but are differentiated by adverse symptoms such as daytime sleepiness or shorter than preferred sleep periods. Irregular sleep–wake type. This type is characterized by fragmented sleep throughout a 24-hour period. An individual with this type does not experience a major sleep period. The individual may experience sleeplessness for long periods of the night and nap excessively during the day. The prevalence of this subtype is not known (American Psychiatric Association,
2013).
  Non-24-hour sleep–wake type. This type is characterized by irregular duration of the entire sleep–wake cycle that is out of sync with the normal light–dark 24-hour cycle. Unlike the other types, individuals with this type do not follow a 24-hour pattern of sleeping. They may sleep too much or too little in any given 24-hour period. This type is common in the blind, affecting approximately 50%


	

  Shift work type. This type is characterized by job-related obligation that occur during normal sleeping periods ( at night), thereby causing excessive sleepiness while on the job and sleeplessness while at home. For the diagnosis to apply, both symptoms must be present. Individuals who suffer from this type are more prone to accidents or lowered performance on the job than if they experienced normal, restful sleep. This type is relatively common in night workers, affecting approximately 7.5%. Individuals who are middle aged or older are more prone to this type (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

The treatments for this disorder may include behavior therapy, education on optimal sleep hygiene, and light therapy. The common goal of these therapies is to help the individual in adapting his or her environmental cues to support optimal sleep. Also, individuals may be prescribed sleep aids such as Lunesta or Ambien to help them fall asleep at a conventional or preferred time. Medication may be used as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with therapy.
Clinical health psychology is a form of psychology that is informed by the biopsychosocial model of health and emphasizes behavioral medicine interventions.

• Behavioral medicine is an interdisciplinary form of modern medicine that integrates the behavioral, biomedical, and social sciences.
• Behavioral psychology is a form of psychology whose aim is to study behavioral adaptation to an environment and its stimuli.
• Biopsychosocial model is a way of conceptualizing (thinking about) health and illness in terms of biological, psychological, and social factors rather than purely in biological terms. It is also referred to as the biopsychosocial perspective.
• Clinical psychology is a form of psychology that integrates science, theory, and practice to increase the knowledge of the psyche and its function. It is also concerned with predicting, assessing, diagnosing, and alleviating psychological problems and related disability.
• Cognitive psychology is a form of psychology whose aim is to study thought and distorted patterns of thinking.
• Humanistic psychology is an experiential form of psychology developed from the work of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, which emphasizes a client’s capacity for self-actualization and unique positive personal growth.
• Psychoanalytic psychology is the form of psychology largely developed by the work of Sigmund Freud, which emphasizes the conflicts





and compromises between the unconscious and conscious mind.
• Psychometric assessment is the direct or indirect measurement of psychological differences.
• Psychosomatic model is a way of conceptualizing (thinking about) certain medical conditions as caused by or resulting from psychological factors.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.



Clinical health psychology is a form of clinical psychology that is informed by the biopsychosocial model of health. This contrasts with conventional clinical psychology, which tends to focus on the psychosocial model (psychological and social factors explain health and illness), and conventional medicine, which focuses on the biomedical model (biological factors sufficiently explain health and illness). Clinical health psychology emphasizes the clinical and scientific contributions of behavioral medicine in predicting, assessing, diagnosing, and alleviating psychological problems and related disability. Often the root cause of psychological dysfunction is not isolated to a single contributing factor. Instead, it is usually best explained through the integration of biological, psychological, and social systems contributing factors. For example, behavioral psychology, cognitive psychology, humanistic psychology, psychoanalytic psychology, and biomedical model all have different ways to explain and treat a single psychopathology. It honors the contributions of all applicable biological, psychological, and sociological conceptual models.
Clinical health psychology is a system of psychological subspecialties rather than a separate psychological specialty. As an integrative system, it emphasizes the partnership between psychology and medicine. Such collaborative efforts between clinical health psychologists and other medical and health professionals


have markedly contributed to the understanding of psychopathology (dysfunctional thoughts and behavior). These efforts have also furthered the team-based practice of integrative medical and psychotherapeutic interventions. The inclusion of behavioral medicine allows clinical health psychology to expand its focus to include all physiological and psychological factors related to illness. Clinical health psychologists are professionals with a doctoral degree in psychology, specialized training in health, and licensure as a psychologist. They are involved in the treatment of chronic pain, headaches, cessation of cigarette smoking, substance abuse, and management of obesity. Some are also involved in the treatment of heart disease and many other chronic medical conditions. Accordingly, they practice primarily in clinics, hospitals, and other health-care settings.

The relationship of the mind and body have been the subject of intense discussion over the centuries. The early Greek philosophers, such as Hippocrates, documented the collaboration between mind, especially with regard to psychology, and body, particularly with regard to medicine. Later influences, including western religion’s view of human nature, resulted in a lead to a philosophy of mind–body dualism. Mind–body dualism views illness as either a medical condition caused by biological dysfunction, such as an infection, or a psychological dysfunction caused by trauma or evil spirits. However, in the 19th and 20th centuries, Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) and others developed the foundation for a science of the mind and mind–body interaction. At the same time, Lightner Witmer (1867–1956) established the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania in 1896. He first used the term “clinical psychology” in 1907 in the journal The Psychological Clinic.
Clinical psychology evolved largely from both
psychometric assessment and psychoanalytic psychology. The first university programs leading to the doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree were established in 1946 and were accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). The APA was established in 1892 but did not develop a section devoted to clinical psychology until 1919. This section was revised in 1945





to become APA’s Division 12, The Society of Clinical Psychology. Division 12 of the APA is one of the most influential psychological organizations to date. The Veteran’s Administration and APA influenced the integration of psychotherapy into graduate training programs in clinical psychology. This integration of scientific research and psychotherapeutic practice in training programs is known as the scientist-practitioner model. It is also known as the “Boulder Model” because Boulder, Colorado, was the location of the professional conference at which the model was accepted by representatives of the profession. It was not until 1973 that the doctor of psychology (PsyD) was accepted by the APA and recognized by the profession. These alternative training programs are known as practitioner-scholar models or the “Vail Model.”
   Starting in the 1940s, many psychiatrists and clinical psychologists working at the interface of psychology and medicine adopted the psychosomatic model. Franz Alexander (1891–1964), a Hungarian American physician and psychoanalyst, was a main force in advocating for psychosomatic viewpoint. It was largely a psychological explanation that emphasized the power of the mind over the body. For example, duodenal (stomach) ulcers were believed to be caused by frustration and emotional stress. The psychosomatic model began to wane as research determined that there was, in fact, both biological and psychological factors involved. Research identified an infection with the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria along with psychological stress as causative factors in ulcers. Prior to this discovery, the psychiatrist George L. Engel (1913–1999) wrote about the need for a new medical model in a landmark article in Science in 1977. Engel proposed the biopsychosocial model, which could integrate the psychosomatic model with the biomedical model.
As the biopsychosocial model has become increasingly accepted in health-care settings, clinical health psychologists have become indispensable team members in behavioral medicine and the health-care system. The cost of health care in the United States has also been a factor in the utilization of clinical health psychologists. Clinical health psychology has made the case that psychologists with specialty training in health psychology and behavioral medicine are invaluable in


reducing the financial burden of managing preventable illnesses.



Clinical mental health counseling is a distinct helping profession with national standards for education, training, and clinical practice.


Mental health counselors (MHCs) provide a variety of mental health services including psychotherapy; assessment and diagnosis of mental health disorders; substance abuse treatment; crisis management; treatment planning; psychoeducation, prevention programs; and evidence-based therapies. MHCs provide services in a variety of settings, including agency-based services; substance abuse treatment centers; and hospitals, employee assistance programs, private practice and managed health-care organizations. MHCs provide services to individuals of all ages, families, and couples.


Clinical mental health counseling takes place within a wellness model, meaning the goal of counseling is to help the person move toward higher levels of wellness





rather than to cure an illness. Personal and emotional issues are understood from within a human growth and development perspective, which is a holistically focused approach to helping. Prevention is also a key value of clinical mental health professionals. The goal of counseling is to empower and assist clients in solving problems independently. Counseling is considered a collaborative and transitory process through which clients increase their problem-solving skills and self-understanding.


Clinical MHCs are highly trained professionals. MHCs earn a master’s or doctoral degree from a counselor education or closely related program. Education


training, and supervision; research and publications; and resolving ethical issues.
   Clinical mental health counseling is a distinct helping profession with a unique focus on wellness, prevention, and empowerment.
Clinical Psychology

programs are accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) and range from 48 to 60 semester hours depending on the area of specialization. The core areas of mental health education programs approved by the CACREP include diagnosis and psychopathology, psychotherapy, psychological testing and assessment, professional orientation, research and program evaluation, group counseling, human growth and development, counseling theory, social and cultural foundations, lifestyle and career development, and supervised practicum and internship. Licensure requirements for clinical MHCs are equivalent to two other disciplines (clinical social worker and marriage and family therapist) that require a master’s degree for independent practice. A licensed clinical MHC has the following professional qualifications: an earned master’s degree in counseling or a closely related mental health discipline, completed a minimum of two-year postgraduate clinical work under the supervision of a licensed or certified mental health professional, and passed a state or national licensure or certification examination.
Clinical MHCs adhere to a rigorous code of ethics and professional practice standards. The American Counselors Association code of ethics consists of eight sectional headings addressing counseling issues: the counseling relationship; confidentiality; professional responsibility; relationship with other professionals; evaluation, assessment, and interpretation; teaching,

Clinical psychology is the branch of psychology involved with the assessment and treatment of mental illness, abnormal behavior, and psychiatric conditions.


• Behavioral psychology is a form of psychology whose aim is to study behavioral adaptation to an environment and its stimuli.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that addresses maladaptive thought distortions that lead to unwanted emotional and behavioral symptoms.
• Cognitive psychology is a form of psychology whose aim is to study thought and distorted patterns of thinking.
• Humanistic psychology is an experiential form of psychology developed out of the work of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, which emphasizes a client’s capacity for self-actualization and unique positive personal growth.
• Practice is a method or process used to accomplish a goal or objective.
• Psychoanalytic psychology is the form of psychology largely developed by the work of Sigmund Freud, which emphasizes the conflicts





and compromises between the unconscious and conscious mind.
• Psychometric assessment is the direct or indirect measurement of psychological differences.
• Psychopathology is a maladaptive experience of suffering or aspect of a psychological condition incorporating cause, development, structure, and consequences.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.



Clinical psychology is the branch of psychology that involves the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of psychological disorders and behavioral conditions. It integrates knowledge from scientific research and professional practice. The goal of this integration is to enhance the ability to predict, assess, diagnose, and alleviate psychological problems and related dysfunction. Traditionally, there are three major theoretical perspectives in the practice of clinical psychology and psychotherapy. They are the psychoanalytic, cognitive behavioral, and humanistic traditions. More recently, systems theory has been incorporated into many aspects of clinical psychology. Theoretical orientations such as these guide clinical psychologists’ research interests or work with clients. Clinical psychology is a system of subspecialties more than it is a single psychological specialty. There is so much diversity in clinical psychology. This leads to the establishment of many sub-specializations within clinical psychology. In addition, the profession undergoes rapid developmental changes as new information is acquired via science and practice. However, clinical psychologists tend to specialize as scientific researchers, clinical practitioners, or some combination of the two. Clinical psychology researchers are primarily interested in empirical study and the publication of novel scientific findings. Research in clinical psychology influences diverse areas of society, including education, medicine, and public policy. Practitioners of clinical psychology utilize the


research findings to inform their work with persons suffering from some form of psychopathology. Clinical psychology practice often utilizes psychometric assessment and psychotherapeutic intervention.


Lightner Witmer (1867–1956) established the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania in 1896. Witmer published the term “clinical psychology” in a professional journal he established in 1907, titled The Psychological Clinic. Clinical psychology was developed out of psychometric and psychoanalytic forms of psychology. This history is most clearly evidenced by the development and military use of intelligence tests by the United States during World War I. These psychometric assessments, named Army Alpha and Army Beta, were used to determine how military enlistees would be utilized in the war effort. The United States’ Veterans Administration became aware that many veterans returning from the war required treatment related to psychological trauma. After World War II there were increasing numbers of veterans with psychological trauma from “shell shock.” As a result, the Veteran’s Administration underwrote the development of university doctoral programs in clinical psychology.
The first university programs leading to the doctor
of philosophy (PhD) degree were established in 1946 and were accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). The APA was established in 1892 but did not develop a section devoted to clinical psychology until 1919. This section was revised in 1945 to become APA’s Division 12, The Society of Clinical Psychology. Division 12 of the APA is one of the most influential psychological organizations to date. The Veteran’s Administration and APA influenced the integration of psychotherapy into graduate training programs in clinical psychology. This integration of scientific research and psychotherapeutic practice in training programs is known as the scientist-practitioner model. It is also known as the “Boulder Model” because Boulder, Colorado, was the location of the professional conference at which the model was accepted by representatives of the profession. It was not until 1793 that the doctor of psychology (PsyD) was accepted by the APA and recognized by the profession.





These alternative training programs are known as practitioner-scholar models or the “Vail Model.”


A clinical trial is a research study for comparing a new medication or treatment with an existing medication or treatment to determine its efficacy and safety. It is also known as clinical research trials.

• Effectiveness refers to how well a treatment works (produce a beneficial effect) in the clinical practice of medicine.
• Efficacy refers to how well a treatment works (produce a beneficial effect) in clinical trials.
• Food and Drug Administration is the federal agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of all drugs, vaccines, and medical devices.
• National Institutes of Health is a federal agency that conducts or supports biomedical research, including sponsoring clinical trials.
• Placebo is an inactive form of treatment (often a sugar pill) that has no treatment value.
• Randomized controlled trial is a research design in which participants are assigned randomly (by chance) to an experimental treatment or one that receives a comparison treatment or


placebo. It is also referred to as randomized clinical trial.
• Recruiting is the time frame that a clinical trial has to identify and enroll participants in the trial.


Clinical trials are research studies that utilize medical tests to determine the indications, efficacy, and safety of a new medication or treatment intervention. Such trials involve the monitoring of the various effects on large groups of individuals. They are used to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of a new treatment in comparison with the current standard of care or an existing treatment for a disease or disorder. In the United States, new medical treatments or devices must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before they can be released for widespread use. Such approval requires rigorous testing in randomized controlled trials to determine whether it is effective in treating the medical condition. This testing is also used to determine the type and extent of side effects that may result.
   Clinical trials are conducted by researchers affiliated with government health agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a medical center, medical school, independent researchers, or private industry. Participants are recruited, as either volunteers or paid research subjects. Usually, participants are divided into two or more groups, including a control group that does not receive the experimental treatment, receives a placebo (inactive substance) instead, or receives a conventional treatment for comparison purposes.
   For some individuals, clinical trials provide an opportunity for receiving new treatments that are not otherwise available. Those with difficult-to-treat or incurable medical conditions, like AIDS and certain cancers, can participate in clinical trials if standard therapies are not effective.


Clinical trials have a rather long and rich history. About 605 BC what appears to be the first documented clinical trial is recounted in the book of Daniel. In it King Nebuchadnezzar ordered that children of royal blood






were to eat only meat and wine. Daniel requested an exemption for himself and three other men to eat only bread and water. It wo that the enforced consequences, for example uld be an experiment trial for 10 days in which one group would eat the king’s diet and the other group would eat only bread and water. After the trial Daniel and the three children were noticeably healthier. Since this first trial, conducting clinical trials has been greatly refined. In 1747 James Lind conducted the first controlled clinical trial on sailors suffering from scurvy. All sailors were placed on the same diet, but one group was also given cider and vinegar, while the other group was given lemon juice. The group who had the lemon juice supplement recovered from scurvy in just six days.


Placebos were used in clinical trials for the first time in 1863. Since then there have been several refinements in how clinical trials have been designed and run.
   There are various types of clinical trials: The most common is treatment trials. These trials test the relative effectiveness of new drugs or treatments or combinations of drugs and treatments. A second type of clinical trial is prevention trials. These trials are used to research ways for preventing a disease in individuals who have not previously had it. They are also used to prevent its return in those who were diagnosed and were then successfully treated. A third type of clinical trial is diagnostic trials. These trials seek to find better ways to diagnose a disorder or illness. A fourth type of clinical trial is screening trials to determine the best way to detect a disease or disorder. A fifth type of clinical trial is the quality-of-life trial. These trials are used to investigate how to increase quality of life (making life easier or more normal) for those diagnosed with a chronic illness. Clinical trials usually have four phases. Each phase has a different purpose within the trial. Phase I trials involve a small group of participants (20 to 80). It focuses on evaluating the safety and potential side effects of a drug or treatment. It also helps in determining a recommended dosage. In Phase II, the treatment or drug is tested in more participants (100 to 300) to determine its efficacy, effectiveness, and safety. In Phase III, even more participants (1,000 to 3,000) are involved. In this phase the intervention is compared to standard treatments, and further information is collected about its safety and side effects. In Phase IV, post-marketing studies are carried out when the drug or intervention is widely available. The purpose of this phase is to collect additional data on the optimal use of the treatment and to further evaluate its side effects. The research hospital of the NIH conducts ongoing clinical trials on medical treatments, medications, and therapies for various medical conditions. It continually recruits volunteers in many of these clinical trials.

Cliques are small groups of friends with shared values, characteristics, and interests, who usually prefer to socialize exclusively with one another.

• Peer groups are informal associations of people that arise from similarities in age, background, social status, and interests.
• Peer pressure describes the positive or negative influence one’s peer group, or clique, has on one’s attitudes, values, and behaviors.


The term “clique” is derived from the 18th-century Old French term cliquer, meaning to “make a noise,” and its later derivative, the English term “claque,” referring to a group of people hired to applaud or publicly support someone. In the modern sense, the word “clique” describes a small, tight-knit group of people with similar qualities, values, interests, and behaviors. Generally, “cliques” refer to groups of adolescents who hang out primarily with one another. Both males and females form and join cliques. Those who are associated with adolescent cliques generally look, dress, think, and act the same. Some commonly used terms that refer to cliques that may exist in a present-day school include nerds, jocks, preps, Goths, emos, punks, surfers, skaters,


gamers, and the “popular” group, or “in crowd.” Subgroups have also been identified within these groups (e.g., “band geeks,” “football jocks,” “Honors kids”).
   These informal associations of people have positive and negative characteristics, though a prevailing negative connotation of the word “clique” does exist in mainstream culture. On the positive side, cliques can provide a sense of connectedness, belonging, and safety helping members feel important, valued, wanted, and included. In addition, members of cliques often stick up for one another or have one another’s back—a quality of particular importance in the adolescent world. On the other hand, cliques can have negative consequences. Cliques, by definition, are exclusionary, so those who are not members may feel judged, undervalued, or rejected. Even those associated with the clique can struggle. Members may experience acting differently when they are in their clique than when they are not with them. Peer pressure is heightened in this type of social environment as well, which can cause the individual to behave in ways that conflict with his or her personal sense of self, values, and feelings. This issue of conformity versus nonconformity is profound in cliques as there is often a set of both spoken and unspoken rules that govern the group’s cohesion. Under these circumstances, cliques may engage in bulling behavior—as power and social dominance play a key role in maintaining group dynamics. The book Queen Bees and Wannabees articulates this phenomenon from the adolescent girl’s perspective. Thus, cliques have established hierarchies both within the group itself and among varying groups within the given setting (a school), and these levels of power are often made known to members and nonmembers alike.

Social status among peers and between peer groups has been an area of interest for educators, psychologists, counselors, and sociologists for decades. The peer group one associates with can have an indelible influence on how that person thinks, feels, and acts, essentially affecting the person’s overall growth and development. Group association can impact academic performance, behavior, self-esteem, and self-worth, which are critical





in determining one’s future trajectory and long-term success. Research indicates that an individual’s rank in a clique is associated with both the social behaviors the individual uses within the group and the degree of lik-ability by friends and peers. Findings also suggest that, good or bad, the most dominant group members get rewarded. However, there is increasing evidence to support that the range of accepted cliques is on the rise. Furthermore, traditionally deemed “popular” groups no longer have the influence they once had. Though dominant groups may still exist, most young people seek and are often successful in finding a social circle that fits them as individuals. Providing opportunities for youth to engage, including group projects and extracurricular activities, may remedy clique formation and rivalry.




 It employs disturbingly violent images to comment on psychiatry, juvenile delinquency, youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects pertinent to the United Kingdom at that time.
   The story depicts the main character, Alex, leading a gang of teenagers who go on the rampage every night, beating, raping, and murdering helpless victims. Eventually Alex is arrested and charged for his crimes. While in jail, he volunteers as a subject for aversion therapy in an effort to shorten his sentence. This kind of therapy is a treatment in which the patient is discouraged from a behavior by being subjected to a punishing stimulus when engaged in that behavior. The aversion therapy itself is violent. When Alex is eventually released from jail because he is cured, he initially hates violence. Eventually the people he meets and interacts with treat him so violently that inevitably he returns to a life of violence and sadism. So while after aversion therapy, Alex behaves for a while as if he were a good member of society, his new behavior does not really result from his own free choice. His goodness is involuntary. In the end he has become the clockwork orange of the title, organic on the outside, mechanical on the inside.
   The film’s central moral question, as in the book from which the movie was derived, is the definition of goodness. It asks whether it makes sense to use aversion therapy to stop immoral behavior. It is likened to the age-old question of whether a good end can justify evil means. The film raises several interesting questions without resolving them. What is

		goodness? Is it acceptable to use violent means in an

A Clockwork Orange is a film directed and released by Stanley Kubrick in 1971, which depicts the isolation and violence among rebellious youth in Britain.


The issue of how society could react to control the growing alienation and violence among young people became a prominent and popular theme, especially because of the social revolutions of the 1960s. Stanley Kubrick’s 1971 film A Clockwork Orange is an adaptation of Anthony Burgess’s 1962 novel of the

attempt to stop violent behavior? Is aversion therapy effective?
   Stanley Kubrick, the director of the movie, described the film in this way: “A social satire dealing with the question of whether behavioral psychology and psychological conditioning are dangerous new weapons for a totalitarian government to use to impose vast controls on its citizens and turn them into little more than robots.” He also wrote: “It is a story of the dubious redemption of a teenage delinquent by condition-reflex therapy. It is, at the same time, a running lecture on free-will” (Houston, 1971, 43).








The movie is a clear depiction of the dilemma that arises as a result of classical conditioning where the first step is pairing a behavior with a stimulus. In this movie, Alex is conditioned to associate violence with nausea. There is a possible second step, where there is an extinction of the pairing, whether intentional or not, but it is important to know that in the movie it is unintentional. This happens when the person discovers that the enforced consequences, for example, nausea because of drugs not because of violence, are shown to no longer have an effect. Since the change in behavior was artificial, or forced, the subject is then free to resume the original behavior without feeling any further negative consequences. In much less dramatic and dangerous forms, aversion therapy has been tried many times to limit or eliminate habits judged to be negative such as homosexuality and

addictions to drugs and alcohol with limited or damaging effect.



Clozaril is an atypical antipsychotic medication used to alleviate the symptoms and signs of schizophrenia,





particularly for those who have not responded to any other antipsychotic drug. Its generic name is clozapine.


• Atypical antipsychotic is a class of newer generation antipsychotic medications that are useful in treating schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
• Extrapyramidal symptoms are side effects caused by certain antipsychotic medications. They include repetitive, involuntary muscle movements, such as lip smacking, and the urge to be moving constantly.
• Tardive dyskinesia is a disorder involving involuntary and repetitive body movements that can develop after long-term use of certain antipsychotic medications.

Clozaril is considered an atypical antipsychotic medication that differs from typical antipsychotics in its effectiveness in treating schizophrenia and its profile of side effects. It was the first atypical antipsychotic drug to be developed. Clozaril may reduce the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia in a large proportion of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who have not responded to typical antipsychotics. It is intended for use in those with severe schizophrenia who have not responded to any other antipsychotic drug or who have experienced intolerable side effects. It is estimated that as many as 20%–60% of those with schizophrenia are treatment resistant. Clozaril is believed to work by blocking the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in the limbic system, a region of the brain involved with emotions and motivation.
   As an atypical antipsychotic it is to less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia and other extrapyramidal (pertaining to a neural network in the brain) side effects. Tardive dyskinesia involves involuntary movements of the tongue, jaw, mouth, or face or other groups of skeletal muscles. The incidence of tardive dyskinesia increases with increasing age and with increasing


dosage. It may also appear after the use of the antipsychotic has stopped. Women are at greater risk than men for developing tardive dyskinesia. There is no known effective treatment for this syndrome, although gradual (but rarely complete) improvement may occur over a long period.

Clozaril can cause agranulocytosis, a life-threatening depletion of white blood cells. It can cause epileptic seizures in about 5% of those taking Clozaril. Because seizures are dose related, that is, increasing as the dose of the drug is increased, Clozaril should be discontinued or the dose reduce to stop the seizures. Clozaril should be used in pregnant women only when strictly necessary. Infants born of mothers on Clozaril show extrapyramidal symptoms and symptoms of withdrawal, including agitation, trouble breathing, and difficulty feeding. Clozaril may also be secreted in breast milk, so breast-feeding is not advisable. Clozaril can cause sedation and may interfere with driving and other tasks requiring alertness. The drug may increase the effects of alcohol and sedatives.
   Clozaril can cause a number of side effects, including decreases of blood pressure, rapid heart rate, changes in heart rhythm, sedation, increased appetite, excessive salivation, nausea, constipation, abnormal liver tests, elevated blood sugar, blurred vision, dry mouth, nasal congestion, decreased sweating, difficulty urinating, skin rash, weight gain, and fever.





The movie Clueless, released in 1995, was a popular teen comedy based loosely on the novel Emma directed by Amy Heckerling and starring newcomer Alicia Silverstone.


Clueless is a teen-pop culture film that was released in the United States on July 19, 1995. It was written and directed by Amy Heckerling and produced by Scott Rudin. The comedy is very loosely based on Jane Austen’s 1815 novel Emma. Alicia Silverstone stars as the lead character, Cher Horowitz. Other actors in the film include Stacey Dash (Dionne Davenport), Paul Rudd (Josh), and Brittany Murphy (Tai Frasier).
   The movie is set in Beverly Hills and follows Cher’s life as she navigates the social scene in high school. Cher is attractive, popular, wealthy, and fashion-obsessed. Her downfall is that she is also extremely superficial. She lives in a mansion with her father Mel (Dan Hedaya), a powerful litigator in town. Her mother died after suffering complications from a liposuction surgery. Cher is the envy of her peers. Her best friend Dionne is also rich, pretty, and popular. One of the only people to find fault with Cher is her socially conscious ex-stepbrother Josh, who is home visiting on break from college. Cher and Josh verbally spar about one another’s shortcomings, though never maliciously. In an effort to prove her selflessness, Cher sets out on several “community service projects.” First, Cher decides to play matchmaker to two of her teachers in an attempt to have them soften up on their grading so she can improve her report card. They find happiness and Cher decides that she enjoys helping others, so she moves onto her next project. So she befriends the new, unhip girl at school, Tai, in hopes of turning her popular. This plan backfires when Tai rises to top social status and eventually turns her sights on Josh. It is then that Cher realizes her true feelings for Josh and humbles herself in an effort to win his heart. She allows Tai to be her true self and pursue her feelings for another love interest. In the end, Cher and Josh find love once Cher abandons




her selfish ways and begins to appreciate the people in her life.


Clueless became a surprise sleeper hit when it grossed over $11 million on its opening weekend, finishing no. 2 behind the movie Apollo 13. In its box office run it grossed $55 million, the 32nd highest-grossing film of 1995. It catapulted Alicia Silverstone to international star status. Critics have also rated the film favorably. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly ranked it 42nd out of 100 “New Classics” released between 1983 and 2008. The magazine also named it the 19th best comedy of the past 25 years. The movie spun off to a television sitcom and a series of books. Much of the pop-culture lingo from the movie is still used by youth





today, including phrases like “Whatever,” “As-if,” and, the movie’s title, “Clueless.”

Coaching

Coaching is a developmental process in which a coach enables an individual to meet his or her goals for improved performance, personal growth, or career enhancement.


• Business coaching is a form of coaching in which a coach works with an employee (below the level of executive) to enhance the employee’s awareness and behavior in order to better achieve the business objectives of both the employee and his or her organization.
• Executive coaching is a form of coaching in which a coach works collaboratively with an executive to accomplish specific goals and objectives involving the executive’s productivity and well-being. It is short term and focuses on increasing skills and performance or on personal and professional development.
• Executive consultation is a form of consultation in which a consultant functions as a sounding board and expert advisor to address a broad range of professional and personal issues of concern to the executive. It is often an ongoing and long-term process.


• Personal coaching is a form of coaching in which a coach works to improve the quality of his or her client’s life, by offering advice on a broach array of personal and professional matters, including career, health, and personal relationships. It is also known as life coaching.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.


When hearing or seeing the word “coaching” many think of sports coaching. In sports, a coach gives directions, instruction, and training of the on-field operations of an athletic team or of individual athletes. Today, many other forms of coaching have developed, in which coaches have different goals and roles than sports coaches. Increasingly, newer forms of coaching are regularly utilized and sought by a broad array of organizations and individuals who are not sports teams nor athletes. A common misconception is that coaching is the same as psychotherapy or therapeutic counseling. In fact they are quite different. The goal of psychotherapy is to assist individuals to recover from emotional or other psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, or grief. In contrast, the goal of coaching is to assist normal, healthy individuals to achieve personal goals such as clarity on career objectives, increased well-being, or improved work–life balance.


These newer forms of coaching include business coaching, personal coaching, and executive coaching. These forms of coaching focus on one of two objectives. The first is to increase the individual’s personal development. The second is to increase the individual’s professional performance. It is interesting to note that the original meaning of the word “coaching” is derived from the word “carriage,” which in the English language means to convey an individual from where he or she is to where he or she wants to be. The assumption is that focusing on the individual’s overall development





will lead to increased professional effectiveness and job performance. Those who practice personal coaching, also called life coaching, emphasize this objective. On the other hand, those who view that the purpose of coaching is primarily to improve professional performance enhancement and secondarily personal development are more likely to practice business coaching. If the employee is an executive, it is called executive coaching.
   Executive coaching is similar but different from executive consultation. Executive consultation addresses a broader range of professional and personal concern than are typically addressed in executive coaching. Issues in executive consultation can range from complex financial and personnel decisions to delicate personal health issues. Accordingly, it requires a seasoned consultant with an encyclopedic knowledge and broader experience base than is required of executive coaches. The signature characteristic of this form of consultation is that the consultant serves a sounding board and expert advisor who can quickly and effective assess the personal and organizational dynamics influencing the executive’s concerns. In executive coaching, the coach also works collaboratively with an executive but with a different focus. The focus of such coaching is on increasing specific skills, performance, or development. It is usually directed at communicating vision and acting strategically, understanding individual and organizational dynamics, building relationships and mobilizing commitment facilitating team performance, or improving specific corporate results. Unless it is part of an ongoing leadership development program, executive coaching tends to be fairly focused and of short duration.



Kurt Cobain was the lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter of the pop-culture grunge band, Nirvana. His rise to musical fame in the 1990s is well noted along with his tumultuous relationship with girlfriend and later wife, Courtney Love, and ongoing struggles with drug addiction.


Kurt Donald Cobain was born on February 20, 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington, to his parents, Wendy Elizabeth (Fradenburg) and Donald Leland Cobain, a waitress and automotive mechanic. Kurt had one sibling, younger sister, Kimberly. Cobain’s family was filled with artistic and musical influences. His grandmother, Iris Cobain, was a professional artist. Kurt began drawing at an early age and his bedroom was often described as an art studio filled with drawings of his favorite cartoon characters. Musical talent was also present in the family. His Uncle Chuck Fradenburg was in the band The Beachcombers, his Aunt Mari Earle played guitar, and his great-uncle Delbert was an Irish tenor singer who made an appearance in the 1930 film King of Jazz. Kurt began singing and playing musical instruments at an early age. His Uncle Chuck gave him his first guitar, a prized gift.
Kurt’s parents officially divorced when he was
nine years old. This experience had a profound effect as he grew more sullen, withdrawn, and defiant. Though his parents both found new partners, neither household was well received by Kurt. He did not get the level of attention he was used to in his father’s, and his mother was involved in a domestic violence situation. After seeking therapy for Kurt, his parents were advised that a single-family environment would be most beneficial, so on June 28, 1979, Cobain’s mother granted full custody to his father.
   Cobain spent his high school years back and forth between his parents and other family members. His behavior problems continued as well. He dropped out

of Aberdeen High School just two weeks shy of graduation after realizing he did not have adequate credits to graduate. His time was then spent at odd jobs, oftentimes unemployed, and following favored punk bands from concert to concert. A few years later he persuaded a fellow devotee, Krist Novoselic, to partner up with him to form the beginnings of Nirvana. The band struggled initially with its first album Bleach, trying out a few different drummers and finally settling on Dave Grohl, with whom they found their greatest success. In 1991, their major label debut album, Nevermind, was released.
   The lead single, “Smells Like Teen Spirit” from that album, was the platform the band needed to


catapult into mainstream, rising to the top of the alternative rock/grunge movement. Since the debut of Nevermind (1991), Nirvana has sold over 25 million albums in the United States and over 50 million worldwide. Despite this success, Cobain was always uncomfortable with the spotlight and felt misinterpreted by the media. The band released its third album, In Utero, in 1993.
   Though his professional life was on the rise, Cobain’s personal life remained tumultuous. On January 12, 1990, in a Portland nightclub, Kurt Cobain met Courtney Love, the head of the rock band Hole. The two began dating and found common ground in their drug addictions. After dating a short while, Courtney revealed that she was pregnant and the couple subsequently married on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii on February 24, 1992. The couple’s daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born on August 18, 1992. Tabloid reports then surfaced speculating about Courtney’s drug use during her pregnancy. A judge ordered the couple to give up custody and leave Frances in the care of Courtney’s sister Jamie. After months of legal battles and conceding to regular drug testing and visits from a social worker, Courtney and Kurt were eventually granted back full custody.
   Though Cobain suffered from bouts of depression and drug abuse throughout his life, it was his addiction to heroine that eventually led him to his first stint in rehab in 1992. His recovery did not last long and he ended up overdosing in 1993. He overdosed again in early March 1994, though this incident has been noted as his first suicide attempt. On March 25, 1994, Love staged an intervention and Cobain agreed to enter rehab again but walked out after only 2 days. He returned to his home in Seattle though reports from family and close friends cannot account for his whereabouts during those few days. On April 8, 1994, Cobain’s body was discovered at his home in Lake Washington. The coroner’s report indicated he suffered one gunshot wound to the head and traces of heroin and diazepam were in his system. A suicide note was also found.


Cobain’s posthumous album “Nirvana: MTV Unplugged” earned him and his band a 1995 Grammy Award. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine named Cobain





the 12th greatest guitarist of all time. Dying at the age of 27, he is considered a member of the “27 Club,” a group of prominent musicians who all died at the age of 27. Other members include Jimi Hendrix, Janis Jop-lin, Jim Morrison, and Amy Winehouse. Kurt Cobain is remembered as one of the most iconic alternative rock musicians of contemporary time. Fascination with his life and the struggles he faced continue, as does the popularity that his musical and artistic talents created.


Cocaine is a stimulant drug that is extracted from the leaves of the coca plant. It produces feelings of euphoria and is highly addictive.


• Stimulant is a drug that increases brain activity and produces a sense of alertness, euphoria, endurance and productivity, or suppress appetite. Examples are cocaine, amphetamines, and Ritalin.


Cocaine is one of the oldest-known psychoactive drugs. Extracted from coca leaves, cocaine was used by the Incas and others in the Andean region of South America for thousands of years as a stimulant. It was also used to depress appetite and to treat high-altitude sickness. It is a substance that can be processed into many forms for use as an illegal drug of abuse. In its most common form, cocaine is a whitish crystalline powder, which is known by such street names as “coke,” “blow,” “C,” “flake,” “snow,” and “toot.” It is most commonly inhaled or snorted. It may also


be dissolved in water and injected. Cocaine produces feelings of euphoria or intense happiness. It also produces hypervigilance, increased sensitivity, irritability or anger, impaired judgment, and anxiety. Because it is highly addictive, the Federal Drug Administration classifies cocaine as a Schedule II drug, which means it has restricted medical usage. For example, a licensed physician can use it as a local anesthetic for certain eye and ear problems and in some kinds of surgery.
   Crack is a form of cocaine that can be smoked and produces an immediate, more intense, and more short-lived high than the powder form. Crack comes in chunks, which are off-white in color, and called “rocks.” Besides their standalone use, both cocaine and crack are often mixed with other substances. Cocaine may be mixed with methcathinone to create a “wild-cat.” Cigars may be hollowed out and filled with a mixture of crack and marijuana. Either cocaine or crack used in conjunction with heroin is called a “speedball.” Cocaine used together with alcohol represents the most common fatal two-drug combination.


The patterns of cocaine abuse in the United States have changed much over the past 30 years. In the annual study, cocaine use among high school seniors was found to have declined from 13.1% in 1985 to 3.1% in 1992. The rate of cocaine use began to rise again and peaked at 5.5% in 1997 (Leshner, 2010). However, use among all ages declined over the same time period, which was attributed in part to education about the risks of cocaine abuse. The incidence of new crack cocaine users has also decreased. A 1997 study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse indicates that among outpatients who abuse substances, 55% abuse cocaine. The lifetime rate of cocaine abuse was reported as 0.2%. More recently, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports that in 2009, 4.8 million Americans aged 12 and older had abused cocaine in any form. It also found that adults 18 to 25 years of age had a higher rate of cocaine use than any other age group.
Cocaine abuse affects both genders and various
populations across the United States. Males are up to





two times more likely to abuse cocaine than females. Cocaine began as a drug of the upper classes in the 1970s, but since then the socioeconomic status of cocaine users has shifted. Cocaine is more likely to be abused by the economically disadvantaged because it is easy for them to get and it is inexpensive. These factors have led to increased violence as those who are cocaine dependent may become involved in illegal activity, like drug dealing to fund their habit. It has also been associated with higher rates of HIV/AIDS among disadvantaged populations.




Codependency is a psychological concept referring to an excessive dependency on others and the thinking, feeling, and behavioral patterns that affect a person’s ability to experience healthy relationships.


Codependency is a concept that originally developed in the field of substance abuse recovery. The prefix “co” is Latin for “together.” Originally codependency described how family members enable a substance abuser’s addictive behaviors (alcohol or drugs use). Enabling is a dysfunctional behavior that is intended to help the substance abuser but actually reinforces the dependency. Enabling behaviors


include taking the blame or making excuses for the substance abuser’s addiction. For example, the codependent wife of an alcoholic calls the husband’s workplace telling the employer that her husband is “sick” and can’t come in to work when in fact he is hung-over and shouldn’t drive or operate machinery. She believes she is helping him by protecting his employment and reputation, and her financial security, but in fact this enables his alcoholism. Her “helping him” shields him from the consequences of his behaviors and keeps him from being accountable or taking responsibility for his substance abuse. Thus, she is “co” dependent, or with him, in his alcoholism even though she does not drink.
   Codependency is not a specific diagnosable mental health condition but it is a term that is used in a variety of situations. The definition of codependency has broadened since it was first identified in the field of addictions. In the fields of counseling and psychology, codependency has come to describe a person’s overdependence on and control of another person to feel good about himself or herself. It has been described as “relationship addiction” in which the relationship is more important than the individual. Individuals who are codependent have an underdeveloped sense of self-esteem and only feel good when others are perceived to need them. As a result codependents have poor boundaries; they try to control the relationship by overly caring for the individual. They do more than their fair share of work; they often feel the martyr and have a need for recognition but are embarrassed when they receive it. How they act, feel, and think goes far beyond normal self-sacrifice and caregiving. They feel guilty if they have to assert themselves, fear being rejected, and have difficulty making decisions for fear that others will disapprove of the decision. Codependents believe that others’ opinions are of more value than their own. They have difficulty admitting mistakes and go to great lengths to appear right in the eyes of the other, even if that means lying. Codependents are most comfortable when they feel needed. As a result they can be controlling, overly nurturing, or overly compliant depending on the nature of the relationship.






Although codependency is not an officially recognized mental health disorder, it is recognized by most mental health professionals as being a condition that affects a person’s ability to have healthy and fulfilling relationships. There is general consensus that codependency develops in childhood as a result of growing up in a dysfunctional family. As such, it is believed that codependent behaviors are learned and can be changed. Individual psychotherapy and couples counseling can be helpful in changing the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with codependency. There are also many books, support groups, website, and online support organizations that address codependency and offer instruction and help to codependents.



Cognitive behavior analysis system of psychotherapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and changing hurtful thoughts and behaviors with more helpful ones. It is also referred to as CBASP.


• Behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive (problematic) behaviors.


• Behavioral analysis is a type of assessment that focuses on the observable and quantifiable aspects of behavior and excludes subjective phenomena such as emotions and motives.
• Cognitive therapy is psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and modifying maladaptive (faulty) thoughts.
• Dialectical behavior therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on learning skills to cope with stress, regulate emotions, and improve relationships.
• Interpersonal psychotherapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on interpersonal relationships and their context and on building interpersonal skills.
• Psychodynamic psychotherapy is a psychotherapy approach that assumes dysfunctional behavior is caused by unconscious, internal conflicts and focuses on gaining insight into these conflicts.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Situational analysis is a type of behavioral analysis in which interpretations (thoughts) and related behaviors in a specific situation are identified.

Cognitive behavior analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) is a psychotherapy approach that combines situational analysis with behavioral, cognitive, and interpersonal methods. It works by helping individuals focus on the consequences of their behavior and to use problem solving to resolve personal and interpersonal difficulties. The basic premise of CBASP is that personal and relational problems or symptoms result from a mismatch between what an individual desires or wants and what actually occurs. The focus of therapy is helping clients discover why they did not





obtain a desired outcome by evaluating and modifying their limiting or hurtful interpretations (thoughts) and behaviors. In this approach individuals are helped to discover why they did not obtain a desired outcome by evaluating their problematic thoughts and behaviors. They identify the discrepancy between what they want to happen in a particular situation and what has happened or is actually happening.
   There are two phases in CBASP treatment: elicitation and remediation. The elicitation phase consists of a detailed situational analysis. This analysis focuses on specific questions: How would you describe the situation? How did you interpret the situation? Specifically, what did you do and what did you say? What did you want to get out of the situation, that is, what was your desired outcome? What was the actual outcome of this situation? And, finally, did you get what you wanted? During the remediation phase, behaviors and interpretations are targeted for change. Then, the individual is helped to select alternative thoughts and behaviors that are more likely to achieve his or her desired outcome. First, each interpretation of the situation is assessed to determine whether it helped or hindered the achievement of the desired outcome. Next, each of the client’s behaviors is similarly analyzed to determine whether it helped or hindered in the attainment of the desired outcome.


CBASP is a form of behavior therapy that was developed by the American psychologist James P. Mc-Cullough (1942–). It combines methods from behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic psychotherapy. McCullough sought to find an effective treatment for chronic depression. Since many chronically depressed individuals engage in emotional thinking and do not learn from previous experience, they remain trapped in life. He developed CBASP to help such individuals to move beyond emotional thinking and learn from their experience. Teaching such individuals to learn from their experience and use problem-solving techniques makes it possible for them to become perceptually aware of behavioral consequences. When


individuals are able to identify the link between their interpretations and behavior and their consequences, they are then able—often for the first time—to use problem-solving methods to resolve both personal and interpersonal difficulties.
   Even though CBASP was initially developed for the treatment of clients with chronic depression, it has extended to mental disorders. These include the various personality disorders, eating disorders, and the anxiety disorder (panic, social anxiety, and general anxiety disorder). It has been said that CBASP can be helpful with nearly all mental disorders except dementia and active psychotic states. It also includes conditions such as anger management, couples issues, parent–child issues, and social skills deficits. It can be used in individual and group formats. CBASP is both a standalone and adjunctive intervention method.
   Research has shown that CBASP is a highly effective treatment approach. A national study involving more than 600 chronically depressed individuals showed that CBASP was more effective than either an antidepressant alone or cognitive behavior therapy alone. However, the when CBASP was combined with the antidepressant, 85% achieved an improvement (50% reduction in symptoms) while 42% achieved remission (elimination of all depressive symptoms) (Mc-Cullough, 2000).





Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of counseling or psychotherapy that focuses on changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as CBT and cognitive behavioral therapy.


• Automatic thoughts are thoughts that spontaneously come to mind when a particular situation occurs.
• Behavior modification is the use of learning principles to increase the frequency of desired behaviors and decrease the frequency of problem behaviors.
• Behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors.
• Cognitive restructuring is a psychotherapy technique for replacing maladaptive thought patterns with constructive thoughts and beliefs.
• Cognitive therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing distorted thinking patterns.
• Dialectical behavior therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on learning skills to cope with stress, regulate emotions, and improve relationships.
• Psychodynamic therapy is a psychotherapy approach that assumes dysfunctional behavior is caused by unconscious, internal conflicts and focuses on gaining insight into these conflicts.
• Rational emotive behavior therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and disputing irrational beliefs.
• Schema therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive schemas.


• Schemas are core beliefs or assumptions about one’s self and the world.


Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapy approach that addresses maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts with various cognitive and behavioral interventions. CBT integrates the cognitive restructuring approach of cognitive therapy with the behavioral modification techniques of behavior therapy. The therapist works with the individual to identify thoughts and behaviors that are causing distress, and then to change those thoughts in order to readjust the behavior. Where individuals have schemas which are flawed and require change, CBT can be employed. Unlike other psychotherapy approaches that focus on insight (understanding), such as the psychodynamic psychotherapy, CBT is “problem focused” (focuses on specific problems) and “action oriented” (strategies that focus on changing actions or behaviors). CBT is time-limited, which means treatment is typically completed in 6 to 20 one-hour sessions.
   CBT can be used with adults, adolescents, and children. It is thought to be effective for the treatment of a variety of psychological conditions. These include mood disorders, personality disorders, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. CBT has also been found to be effective with eating disorders, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
   There are several approaches to CBT, including cognitive therapy, behavior therapy, schema therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. While there are differences among these approaches, they all share a number of common characteristics. These are discussed here.
Focus on cognitive and behavioral factors. A basic
premise of CBT is that individuals’ emotions and behaviors are influenced by their beliefs or thoughts. Because most emotional and behavioral reactions are learned, the goal of therapy is to help individuals unlearn unwanted responses and to learn a new way of responding. The process begins with assessing





maladaptive behaviors and thoughts, including automatic thoughts. By assessing, challenging, and modifying maladaptive beliefs and behaviors, individuals are able to gain control over problems previously believed to be insurmountable.
Direct session activity. CBT is a directive approach
in which therapists typically direct session activity by setting an agenda, decide, plan what will be discussed prior to the session, and actively direct discussion of specific topics and tasks. Cognitive behavior therapists also endeavor to stimulate and engage individuals in the treatment process and these decisions.
Teach skills. Because CBT is also a psychoeducational approach, cognitive behavior therapists teach individuals skills to help them cope more effectively with problematic situations. Dealing directly with skill deficits and excesses is central to individuals achieving and maintaining treatment gains.
Provide information. Cognitive behavior therapists
also discuss the explicit rationale for their treatment and the specific techniques being used. They may provide individuals with detailed information, for example, books or handouts, to orient individuals to the treatment process, to increase their confidence in treatment, and to enhance their ability to cope with problematic situations.
Use homework and between-session activities.
Homework and between-session activities are a central feature of CBT. Such activities provide individuals the opportunity to practice skills learned in sessions and transfer gains made in treatment to their everyday life. Such activities can also foster and maintain symptom reduction.
Emphasize present and future experiences. CBT
focuses on the impact individuals’ present maladaptive thoughts have on their current and future functioning. In addition, skills learned in therapy are designed to promote more effective future functioning.

The term “cognitive behavior therapy” came into usage in the past 40 years or so. It evolved from both the cognitive therapy and behavior therapy traditions in psychotherapy. Behavior therapy in America was pioneered by psychologist Joseph Wolpe


(1915–1997). Cognitively oriented therapies in America were pioneered by psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck (1921–), the developer of cognitive therapy, and by psychologist Albert Ellis (1913–2007), the developer of rational emotive behavior therapy. A useful way of understanding this evolution of CBT is in terms of what has been called the “three waves” of behavior therapy.
First wave. The first wave emphasized traditional
behavior therapy, which focused on replacing problematic behaviors with constructive ones through classical conditioning and reinforcement techniques. Joseph Wolpe pioneered classical conditioning, particularly systematic desensitization. Traditional behavior therapy was a technical, problem-focused, present-centered approach that was markedly different than psychoanalysis, individual-centered therapy, and similar approaches of that era that emphasized the therapeutic relationship and the feelings and inner world of the individual.
  Second wave. The second wave involved the incorporation of the cognitive therapies which focused on modifying problematic feelings and behaviors by changing the thoughts that cause and perpetuate them. The incorporation of cognitive and behavioral therapies in the 1970s was not initially a cordial or conflict-free union, but today most cognitive therapists incorporate key behavioral interventions while most behavior therapists recognize the role of individuals’ beliefs about the consequences of their behaviors The fact that both were problem focused and scientifically based therapies has helped foster this union, resulting in CBT becoming the most commonly practiced treatment method in the United States since the late 1980s.
Third wave. The third wave involved the reformulation of conventional CBT approaches which were based on a modernist paradigm or perspective. In contrast, third wave approaches tend to be more influenced by the postmodern perspective. Accordingly, treatment tends to be more experiential and indirect and utilizes techniques such as mindfulness, dialectics, acceptance, values, and spirituality. Unlike the first and second wave, third wave approaches emphasize second-order change, that is, basic change in structure and/or function, and are based on contextual





assumptions, including the primacy of the therapeutic relationship.





Cognitive behavioral modification (CBM) is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying dysfunctional self-talk in order to change unwanted behaviors.


• Behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors. It is also referred to as behavioral therapy.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing faulty behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as CBT and cognitive behavioral therapy.
• Cognitive therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing automatic thoughts and maladaptive beliefs.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapy and therapeutic counseling.
• Rational emotive therapy is a form of psychotherapy based on the idea that problems


are caused by irrational thoughts, beliefs, and expectations. It was developed by Albert Ellis and is also known as RET. In the 1990s Ellis incorporated the dimension of “behavior” and changed the name to REBT.
• Self-talk is one’s constant internal conversation which can either be encouraging and motivating or discouraging and self-critical.


Cognitive behavioral modification is a combination of cognitive therapy and behavior therapy techniques for fostering healthy thoughts and behaviors. It focuses on identifying dysfunctional (faulty) self-talk in order to change unwanted behaviors. The assumption is that behavior is the result of one’s thoughts and self-talk. The goal of CBM is to teach individuals to observe their own self-talk and behavior and replace it with new, healthier self-talk and behavior.
   There are three phases in the CBM process. The first phase involves self-observation. This involves individuals closely listening to their own self-talk and observing their behaviors. Individuals need to be particularly aware of any negative statements they make about themselves as this will likely contribute to symptoms of anxiety and panic. The second phase involves new self-talk. Once an individual recognizes he or she is engaging in negative self-talk, he or she can begin to change it. When an individual catches himself or herself in negative thought patterns, he or she can recreate new positive self-talk. For example, an individual may say “I can’t take this exam, and I will fail. I am just not smart enough.” A new and healthier self-talk might be: “I know this exam is going to be difficult, but I am going to study and prepare as best as I can.” When an individual makes new self-statements, he or she is guided to new behaviors. This leads to better coping skills, and as each small success builds upon another, an individual can make significant gains in his or her recovery. The third phase of CBM involves learning new skills. Each time an individual can identify his or her negative self-talk, modify it, and change his or her behaviors, he or she is learning new skills. When





individuals are controlled by negative thoughts, it becomes difficult to control behaviors in unpleasant situations. CBM can help an individual change negative thoughts to positive thoughts, and as a result, the individual will begin to behave and act more effectively.
   Psychologist Donald Meichenbaum (1940–) developed CBM in the 1970s. Meichenbaum was greatly influenced by rational emotive therapy. He was one of the first to advocate for combining behavior therapy with cognitive therapy. As a result, he is recognized as one of the founders of cognitive behavior therapy.



Cognitive complexity is an indicator of the degree of complexity (intricacy) or simplicity of an individual’s thinking and perceptual skills.


• Cognitive development is the ability of individuals to think, perceive, and gain an understanding of their world.
• Cognitive model refers to how concepts are related. Such models help one to know, understand, or reproduce the idea they represent.
• Cognitive system is an interrelated system of beliefs, ideas, assumptions, and knowledge.


• Concept is an idea that represents a class of objects or their properties such as “truck” or “green.”
• Construct is a type of schema which is a cognitive model for understanding meaning.
• Domain is a field of personal knowledge.
• Perceptual skill is the ability to develop a mental image or awareness of the elements of the environment.
• Schema is a cognitive model through which an individual understands or assigns meaning to his or her world. A schema is also referred to as a construct.



Cognitive complexity is described as the level of differentiation and integration in an individual’s cognitive system. Differentiation is the number of available constructs in an individual’s cognitive system about a particular domain. Integration is the ability to recognize relationships among cognitive constructs (schemas) in a particular domain. The degree of cognitive complexity helps to predict an individual’s social and clinical judgment (decisions).
   Those who are high in cognitive complexity tend to perceive nuances and subtle differences. Therefore, they are more likely to engage in “both-and” thinking. In contrast, those who are low in cognitive complexity tend not to perceive such nuances and subtle differences. As a result, they are more likely to engage in “black and white” and “either-or” thinking.
   Cognitive complexity is also known as a schema, which is an indicator of how individuals structure their world. An individual’s level of cognitive complexity relates to an individual’s level of cognitive development. The higher the level of an individual’s cognitive development, the higher his or her level of cognitive complexity. For example, increasing the growth and thinking process can lead to higher levels of cognitive complexity. Individuals develop constructs as internal ideas of reality of the world around them. These constructs are based on interpretations of an individual’s observations and experiences. Complexity of cognition





is a result of childhood development and not a personality trait. Parental, familial, and social interactions in early childhood influence the development of the constructs. To the extent that individuals are able to learn from their mistakes and past experiences, their cognitive complexity increases.
   Cognitive complexity is particularly important for counselors and therapists. It is often difficult to understand individuals’ needs, particularly in counseling, because often times their situations are very complex. An individual’s level of cognitive complexity can vary from topic to topic. Given the connection between cognitive complexity and the development of expertise in counseling, programs that train counselors and therapists would do well to integrate cognitive components into their training. Some concrete techniques for integrating cognitive complexity into training curricula include (a) attending to and seeking information about oneself, others, and relationships;
(b) organizing and integrating information into conceptual models; and (c) planning, guiding, and evaluating interventions.



“Cognitive deficit” is a medical term used to describe a variety of brain function impairments.


The word “cognitive” is used to describe any number of mental processes including perception, memory,


judgment, and reasoning. Language and communication are also considered cognitive processes. The term “cognitive deficit” is used to describe a variety of conditions pertaining to problems in a person’s mental process. Cognitive deficits include intellectual impairment, speech and communication impairment, memory impairment, and perceptual impairment.


Cognitive deficits are caused by a number of events and occur in children and adults. Children can be born with cognitive deficits, which can occur as a result of genetic abnormalities, infections, exposure to drugs taken by the mother during pregnancy, and lack of oxygen during birth or in many other ways. Cognitive deficits can occur as a result of acquired brain injuries such as a severe blow to the head, oxygen deprivation from choking or drowning, and brain damage caused by drug use or poisoning. Medical conditions such as strokes or aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease can cause cognitive deficits.


Although there is not a cure for cognitive deficits, they can be treated. Cognitive remediation and cognitive rehabilitation are two types of interventions used to reduce cognitive deficits.
                         



Cognitive dissonance is the emotional discomfort people feel as a result of conflicting beliefs, thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors.






Cognitive dissonance theory is a well-established and highly researched social psychology theory originally proposed by Leon Festinger (1919–1989) in the 1950s. Leon Festinger, one of the top 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, coined the term “cognitive dissonance.” He first used the phrase in his 1956 book When Prophecy Fails, which looked at what happens in the minds of UFO cult members when their beliefs of a prophecy (a UFO landing and the destruction of the earth) failed to come true. In 1957, Festinger explained cognitive dissonance theory and its importance to social psychology in his book A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is one of the most highly studied phenomena in the history of psychology.
   Cognitive dissonance is the psychological and emotional state produced when someone holds conflicting beliefs, thoughts, attitudes, or values and behaves in ways that are incongruent to those cognitions. The perception of an inconsistency creates a negative internal state of discomfort or dissonance. There are many emotions that may be associated with cognitive dissonance, including anxiety, fear, anger, frustration, and embarrassment.
   According to cognitive dissonance theory, people are highly motivated to reduce their cognitive dissonance. Individuals employ several strategies in order to reduce the discomfort. They can modify existing cognitions, that is, change of belief; add new cognitions, that is, add a new belief; or reduce the importance of one of the components of the conflict, that is, change a perception. For example, imagine two separate high school students who aspire to become Olympic athletes. They know that in order to reach their dream they must be dedicated and train several hours each day. Cognitive dissonance would occur when they consider skipping practice for a day at the beach with their friends. They both feel guilty and anxious about missing a day of practice. It is uncomfortable and something must occur in order to reduce the negative feeling. There is a dissonance between their belief of “I want to become an Olympic athlete” and “I want to go to the beach with my friends.” One of them thinks “missing one day of training could make the difference between becoming


an Olympian and not making it; besides, I don’t really like the beach that much” and that person attends practice. The other athlete thinks “I’ve been working so hard I deserve a break; missing one day of training can’t make that big of a difference,” and skips practice. Both were in a state of cognitive dissonance. They were conflicted between their goal of becoming Olympic athletes and going to the beach, a behavior that was in opposition to their goal. One of the students changed her belief by justifying (I deserve a break) and rationalizing (it won’t make a difference) the behavior (a day at the beach). The other student reduced the cognitive dissonance by adding a new belief (one day of training could make a difference) and reducing the importance of one of the components (I don’t like the beach that much), choosing to attend practice.


A tremendous amount of research has been conducted in examining key components of cognitive dissonance theory in adults and children. The concepts of beliefs, attitudes, and motivational systems; psychological and emotional discomfort; compliance dynamics; use of justification and rationalization; and decision making have been studied.
   Cognitive dissonance theory continues to be one of the most studied concepts in psychology. It has been used to examine a multitude of social and psychological problems such as eating disorders, mood and behavior disorders, and substance abuse disorders. It has also been used in studies of relationships, parenting, moral beliefs, racism, prejudice, happiness, attitudes, decision making, motivation, self-perception, and in hundreds of other personal applications. In addition to the social psychology fields, cognitive dissonance research has been conducted in virtually every professional field, including, education, nursing, marketing, economics, finance, law, communication, advertising, and medicine. Cognitive dissonance theory is a concept that has provided insight into human behavior and functioning. Over the past 60 years studies investigating a wide variety of confusing human behaviors have been conducted. These studies have consistently led to the development of helpful interventions and treatments for a





wide variety of problems. Cognitive dissonance theory is sure to continue to offer meaningful insight and understanding into the human condition.




Cognitive problem-solving skills training (CPSST) focuses on decreasing inappropriate and disruptive behaviors in children and adolescents by teaching them constructive ways to solve problems.


CPSST was developed to help reduce significant conduct and behavioral problems in children and adolescents at home, at school, and in the social environment. It focuses on helping children and adolescents learn to manage the thoughts and feelings that often provoke or create the problems to begin with. Dysfunctional behaviors include impulsive, disruptive, annoying, and defiant behaviors; aggressive behaviors; and behaviors that infringe upon the rights of others.
   The goal of CPSST is to decrease dysfunctional behaviors by increasing an individual’s choice in how to respond to social situations. A central precept of CPSST is that children and adolescents are limited in how they interact and respond socially. These limits are


often imposed by the family systems of the child. The individual maturity level of the child also imposes limits to his or her response to problems. The early focus is on discovering irrational interpretations and assumptions that lead to dysfunctional behaviors and acting out. For instance, a child who acts out aggressively in a classroom may have wrongly interpreted that someone is laughing at him or her when in fact it is not so.
   CPSST consists primarily of individual sessions although group treatment sessions can be utilized. Sessions typically last for 45 to 60 minutes and usually occur weekly but can occur more frequently. CPSST uses a cognitive behavioral approach to managing interpersonal conflict and social relationships. An essential component to early treatment is helping the child or adolescent understand how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors work together to form responses to problems. One of the first goals of CPSST is to address the cognitive aspects of the individual’s behavior. How an individual thinks about situations and interprets the actions and behaviors of others is crucial to developing new ways of thinking that lead to new ways of feeling and behaving. Another central aspect of CPSST is helping children gain insight into how they are often a part of the conflict or problem. CPSST then teaches children different skills and techniques in managing thoughts and feelings and in responding appropriately to stressful situations.
CPSST is a collaborative and interactive process
between the client and the therapist. Learning new behaviors through modeling and role-playing is key behavioral elements of CPSST. Teaching alternative ways of responding and affirming new skills are also important behavioral components of CPSST. Homework is often assigned in order for the individual to practice the new skills and new ways of thinking. Homework and events during the week are discussed and evaluated in order to reinforce successful problem solving or correct areas of weakness.
   Successful CPSST results in children being able to be more flexible in social conflicts and less likely to act impulsively. As CPSST progresses, children become more skilled at generating and implementing alternative solutions to conflicts. Another aspect of successful CPSST is an understanding and anticipation of the social consequences of the child’s behaviors on self and others.






CPSST continues to be studied and has been found to be effective in changing problem behaviors in children and adolescents. Alan Kazdin, director of Yale Parenting Center, has conducted extensive research into child conduct problems and is the most cited researcher of CPSST. Kazdin’s clinical research team has studied child-rearing practices, parenting, and ways in which parenting can be altered to improve child functioning at home, at school, and in the community. The team has also examined child and adolescent treatment practices in use in the mental health professions, the clinical and research bases of these practices, and the implications for mental health services. The result of this extensive research has been the development of the “Kazdin Method” of parenting, which uses a combination of cognitive problem solving and parent training. The Kazdin Method has been examined in controlled studies and found to be effective in reducing conduct problems in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17. It has also been found to be effective across diverse ethnic groups.


Cognitive remediation is a psychological treatment approach focused on the improvement of cognitive deficits and problems in living for individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The goal of cognitive remediation is to improve skills most closely tied to living independently, such as holding a job and developing meaningful relationships. Cognitive remediation is used in conjunction with other medical and psychotherapeutic treatments. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of some psychotic disorders, attention disorders, mood disorders, and eating disorders.
   Cognitive remediation and cognitive retraining use similar techniques but have distinct goals. Cognitive retraining focuses on restoring or compensating for cognitive losses after a brain injury. The goal of cognitive remediation is to develop new abilities and skills in individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders.



Cognitive remediation is a type of treatment that assists individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders improve their cognitive skills and increase their social functioning.

Cognitive remediation therapy was originally developed at Kings College in London to improve social functioning of patients suffering from psychological and neuropsychological conditions such as schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation uses exercises and tasks to train the brain and improve neuropsychological function. There are two main techniques used to train brain functions. One is to strengthen the deficit function by targeting the specific impairment in order to increase functioning. The second is to target cognitive strengths and develop strategies to compensate for the impaired function. Assisting patients to think more abstractly, increase attention span, organize increasingly complex problems, and develop skills in problem solving and logic are examples of identified treatment goals. Most frequently, the exercises and tasks in cognitive remediation therapy are administered via computer and often take the form of games. Repetition is an important factor in cognitive remediation. Some examples of task used in cognitive remediation therapy include sentence completion exercises; remembering list of numbers, words, or figures; organizing sequences of numbers, letters, or symbols; and other exercises.





   Conditions and disorders that have symptoms of attention and concentration issues, memory impairment, and organizational problems include attention-deficit disorders and schizophrenia. Other conditions that have symptoms of cognitive impairment include depression and anorexia. For instance, people suffering from depression often report feeling that their “head is in a cloud” and they are unable to think clearly. Individuals suffering from an eating disorder such as anorexia have very rigid thought patterns when it comes to food.


There are numerous studies indicating the effectiveness of cognitive remediation in assisting individuals suffering from a variety of psychological disorders. There are over 100 clinical trials involving more than 2,000 people with schizophrenia indicating cognitive remediation to be effective in improving abilities associated with essential living skills.
   In 2010, Til Wykes, professor of clinical psychology and rehabilitation at the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, called for greater focus in the research of cognitive remediation therapy. He suggested that all researchers adopt and use no more than 10 standardized measures of performance and categorize study participants into meaningful subgroups, such as age or ways of learning. He also called for researchers to investigate more precisely how cognitive changes are brought about and how significantly they affect a person’s life. Further research is currently being conducted investigating the usefulness of this promising technique with other types of conditions in which cognitive impairments are observed.



Cognitive retraining is a form of neuropsychological treatment, which assists brain injury patients restore, or compensate for loss of, cognitive abilities due to a brain injury.


The purpose of cognitive retraining is to assist brain injury patients recover impaired brain functions and improve their quality of life. Cognitive retraining is a rehabilitative technique used by a variety of professionals to improve or restore function to impaired attention, memory, organization, reasoning, understanding, and problem-solving cognitive functions. Assisting brain injury patients improve their awareness of the impact of the injury, accepting their limitations, and adapting to the changes brought about by the injury are important components of cognitive retraining. Developing a sense of well-being within a realistic understanding of the neurobiological changes is an overarching goal of cognitive retraining. Neuropsychologists, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists, among others, can be trained to provide cognitive retraining treatments.


Cognitive retraining is a psychoeducational approach characterized by the therapist’s efforts to improve the patient’s awareness, acceptance, and realism about





his or her injury-related strengths and challenges. Patients are taught to recognize how their neurological strengths and difficulties impact life at home, work, and school and in the environment. There are two categories of cognitive retraining: restorative and compensatory. Restorative retraining helps injured individuals recover functions that have been impaired by injury, stroke, or hypoxia. Compensatory training focuses on assisting patients to cope with and compensate for permanent impairment.
   Cognitive retraining begins with a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of the injured individual. The goal of the assessment is to determine the extent of the injury. It is not uncommon for brain injury patients to be unaware of the extent of their functional impairments, so a complete assessment is essential in planning a course of treatment interventions. The assessment tailors the cognitive retraining to the specific needs of the individual. Studies have indicated that patient buy-in and the ability to “see the big picture” is important to successful outcomes. When patients were able to clearly see the purpose and application of the skills being taught, they were more likely to develop those skills. The relationship between the patient and therapist is also a key factor in positive recovery. A positive working alliance with the therapist, in which there is agreement on therapeutic goals and open and collaborative communication between patient and staff, maximizes treatment potential. Developing a positive working alliance with brain injury patients promotes patient buy-in, fosters positive adaptations, assists in the development of realistic treatment goals, and results in an increase in productivity and quality of life.
Patients receiving cognitive retraining are required to perform a variety of repetitive exercises. Repetition is a key component of cognitive retraining in order for the retrained skill to become automatic. Computers are often used in the cognitive retraining process. Cognitive exercises that target multiple cognitive processes are frequently employed in cognitive retraining. For instance, the “Matching Shapes” exercise addresses functions of memory, motor speed, focused attention, and visual scanning. In the matching shapes exercise, the patient


is shown, at random, one of 15 cards depicting one of four shapes. The patient is required to match the shape on the card by pointing to the correct shape on a picture, which contains 13 different shapes. The patient’s score is the time required to match all 15 shapes correctly. Another example of a cognitive exercise is the “block design” exercise which targets attention/concentration skills, motor dexterity, visual scanning, and visual spatial perception. In the block design exercise, the patient is shown 1 of 10 different drawings of colored squares in differing arrangements. The patient is required to construct a matching structure using colored blocks. The patient is scored by cumulative total time it takes to complete 10 structures.
   Cognitive retraining is an important therapeutic strategy in the recovery and rehabilitation process for individuals suffering from brain injuries. Whether from stoke, injury, or accident, across all ages, cognitive retraining assists individuals in the development of skills needed to live productive, hopeful, and meaningful lives.




Cognitive therapies are a group of psychotherapies that emphasize distorted cognitions and treatment that aims at correcting them. Rational emotive behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and schema therapy are three common cognitive therapies.






• Automatic thoughts are thoughts that spontaneously come to mind when a particular situation occurs.
• Cognitive restructuring is psychotherapy technique for replacing maladaptive thought patterns with constructive thoughts and beliefs.
• Cognitive revolution refers to the shift from a focus on a purely behavioral approach to an acceptance of the role of cognitions as necessary for a fuller understanding of human behavior.
• Cognitive therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing automatic thoughts and maladaptive beliefs.
• Irrational beliefs are distorted and/or self-defeating beliefs that are firmly held despite contradictory evidence. It is also known as maladaptive beliefs.
• Psychoanalysis and the psychoanalytic therapies are a group of psychotherapy approaches that assumes dysfunctional behavior is caused by unconscious, internal conflicts and focuses on gaining insight into these conflicts.
• Rational emotive behavior therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and disputing irrational beliefs.
• Schema therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive (problematic) schemas.
• Schemas are core beliefs or assumptions about one’s self and the world.



Cognitive therapies are a group of psychotherapy approaches for which psychological symptoms and conditions are understood to be caused by distorted thinking or thought processes and which can be


corrected by changing them. They differ in theory and practice from the psychoanalytic therapies and the behavioral therapies. Three cognitive therapy approaches include rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), cognitive therapy (CT), and schema therapy (ST). The cognitive therapies view emotional difficulties as rooted in the clients’ irrational beliefs—REBT, automatic thoughts and maladaptive beliefs—CT, or maladaptive schemas—ST. Cognitive therapists foster change in clients by assisting them to be more aware of their irrational or maladaptive thoughts and beliefs and their problematic impact, and to replace these problematic thoughts with more adaptive ones. A variety of interventions are utilized in the cognitive therapies, particularly cognitive restructuring which is a broad method, including disputation, guided discovery, Socratic questioning, examining the evidence, reattribution, and cognitive rehearsal.

The cognitive therapies arose as a response to the perceived shortcomings of the psychodynamic therapies and of behavioral therapy. Some of the pioneers in the development of the cognitive therapies had psychoanalytic training. These included psychologist Albert Ellis (1913–2007), the developer of REBT, and psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck (1921–), the developer of CT. Others had training in behavior therapy and other approaches, like psychologist Jeffrey Young (1950–), the developer of ST. The “cognitive revolution” of the 1970s was a turning point in the rapid evolution, acceptance, and legitimacy of the cognitive therapies. Historical precursors of the cognitive therapies have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly Stoicism. For example, both Ellis and Beck cite the influence of the Stoic philosophers. One of these, Epictetus, said: “Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them.” More recent influences on the cognitive therapies include Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who said: “I am convinced that a person’s behavior springs from his ideas.” Adler developed Individual Psychology in which the cognitive dimension is a central component.




In 1953, Ellis broke with psychoanalysis and began calling himself a rational therapist. Thereafter, he referred to his approach as rational therapy. His book How to Live with a Neurotic published in 1960 elaborated his new method. As he began to emphasize that emotions followed from thoughts, the approach was renamed rational emotive therapy. Later, as cognitive behavior therapy was becoming the dominant therapeutic approach, he renamed his approach rational emotive behavior therapy to reflect its utilization of behavioral methods.
   REBT employs the ABCD framework, where “A” is the activating event, “B” is the individual’s belief about the event, “C” is the cognitive, emotional, or behavioral consequences of one’s beliefs, and “D” is disputation of the irrational belief. In this approach, personal and relational problems as well as symptoms are viewed as resulting from self-defeating thought processes. These thought processes include self and other-deprecation, catastrophizing, overgeneralizing, and personalizing. The goal of REBT is to change irrational beliefs and self-defeating thought processes into rational beliefs and adaptive thought processes. The focus of treatment is to identify and change the irrational beliefs that underlie disturbed feelings and self-defeating behavior through various cognitive restructuring methods, particularly disputation.


Like Ellis, Beck also broke with the psychoanalysis in the 1960s. Beck’s approach was first articulated in his book Depression: Clinical, Experimental, and Theoretical Aspects published in 1967. Soon after, his approach was criticized by behavioral therapists who denied that there was a cognitive cause for mental conditions. Fortunately, as a result of the “cognitive revolution,” soon behavior therapy techniques and CT techniques became joined together, giving rise to cognitive behavior therapy. However, even though CT had typically included some behavioral methods, Beck and his associates sought to maintain and establish its integrity as a distinct, clearly standardized therapy.
   Theoretically, CT emphasizes the role of cognitive processing in emotion and behavior. It views personality


as shaped by central values or superordinate schemas. Psychological distress is influenced by a number of factors, including biochemical predispositions, different learning history, and cognition reaction style. However, presenting problems and symptoms are understood to result from faulty beliefs and/or maladaptive schemas. The focus of treatment is to become aware of limiting automatic thoughts and confront faulty beliefs with contradictory evidence and develop more adaptive beliefs. Instead of listing specific maladaptive beliefs like Ellis, Beck emphasized that individuals operate from automatic thoughts and core schemas. For example, a woman comes to therapy who is depressed about failing to meet a deadline at her job. Her view of self or self-schema is “I’m worthless and can never do anything right.” Strongly believing, this schema tends to activate automatic thoughts like “Things never work our” and “I’m going to get fired.” These beliefs further worsen her mood. This is intensified if she reacts by avoiding activities that served to confirm her belief that she is worthless. In therapy, the therapist and client would work together to change this and related automatic beliefs. This is done by addressing the way she thinks and behaves in response to similar situations and by developing more flexible ways to think and respond.


Schema therapy is a derivation of CT. Young originally developed it primarily for personality-disordered clients who failed to respond adequately to CT. It was formalized in Young’s 1990 book Cognitive Therapy for Personality Disorders: A Schema-Focused Approach. Schema therapy is a broad, integrative model that shares some commonalities with object relations therapy, experiential therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and interpersonal therapy as well as CT and other forms of cognitive behavior therapy. Despite these similarities, ST differs from these approaches with regard to the nature of the therapy relationship, the general style and stance of the therapist, and the degree of therapist activity and directiveness.
   Basic to ST are early maladaptive schemas which emerge from aversive childhood experiences such as abuse, neglect, and trauma in early life and lead to maladaptive or unhealthy life patterns. The basic goals of





ST are the following: to identify early maladaptive schemas, to validate the client’s unmet emotional needs, to change maladaptive schemas to more functional ones, to promote more functional life patterns and coping styles, and to provide an environment for learning adaptive skills. ST requires considerable training and experience to practice it appropriately and effectively.


College counseling centers offer a range of services to parents and students about higher education application, admission, and successful completion.

• College advising is the process of providing students with the information they need to decide on what postsecondary options are right for them, including application, admittance requirements, coursework progression, and financial aid options.
• College advisor is a professional who offers parents and students with information about preparing for college readiness and future success.
• College readiness counseling is a type of counseling provided individually, in small


groups, or in classroom settings to students prior to postsecondary entrance in an effort to boost preparedness and eventual completion.
• Professional school counselors are counseling practitioners employed in various educational settings who collaborate with parents and teachers to help students develop across academic, social, and career domains.


“College counseling” refers to the process of providing parents and students with information about application, entrance, coursework, and financial aid for college. College counseling can be provided in various settings and can differ in terms of size, set up, and level of service.
   In the high school setting, college counseling may be provided by a guidance counselor or professional school counselor to students on an individual, small group, or classroom basis. Professional school counselors have a master’s degree and hold specialized certification or licensure. These professionals are skilled in the practice of guidance and counseling students.
   College counseling can also be provided to students at the postsecondary level. College counselors have credentials similar to professional school counselors. However, college advisors, sometimes confused with “college counselors,” do not necessarily have backgrounds in counseling. Advisors, rather, have specialized knowledge about the institution or program they service. Many faculty members serve as advisors in higher education settings.
   College counseling is an ongoing process. The goal is not reached at admittance into college but continues as the student succeeds throughout his or her college experience and ends ultimately on completion. Students beginning their postsecondary careers need college counselors to provide them with recommendations about how to navigate college successfully. This may include guidance about choosing an appropriate major, outlining a program of study, and providing information about support services.





College counseling practice first appeared in the early 1900s when it was noted that students were struggling to navigate higher education without proper guidance. At this time faculty members and university presidents were providing these types of services. After 1945, veterans returning from war were in particular need of assistance. This spawned an increase in postsecondary educational and vocational counseling, and expansion in the field continued through the 1970s. During the 1990s and on into the early 21st century, college counseling centers became stable fixtures on campuses.

In 1991, the American College Counseling Association (ACCA), a division of the American Counseling Association, was established. The mission of the ACCA is to support counselors working in higher education so they can foster student success. The organization serves professionals from various disciplines working in college counseling centers, community colleges, and university settings. Most college counseling centers follow the ethical guidelines, standards, and practices outlined by the ACCA. Though challenges and obstacles related to the practice of college counseling continue to arise, the field itself continues to grow due to the high value placed on obtaining a postsecondary degree.


The Columbine shooting is the school rampage shooting that took the lives of 12 students and 1 teacher and injured 24 others.

• Biopsychosocial is the integration of biological, psychological (thoughts, feelings, and behaviors), and social (environmental and cultural) factors to understand and explain human behavior.
• School rampage shooting refers to the act of a student or former student attacking a school with a gun with the initial intent to shoot a specific target but injures or kills at least one other person. It is differentiated from other forms of schools violence and from workplace violence.
• Sociocultural refers to the combination of social and cultural factors.

The Columbine shooting is the rampage shooting committed by two seniors at Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado. On April 20, 1999, these students executed a complex attack on the school that involved guns, bombs, and explosive devices. The perpetrators, Eric Harris (1981–1999) and Dylan Klebold (1981–1999), also took their own lives at the end of their terror attack. In 1996, Harris created a private website where he posted a blog on gaming. Eventually the blog became a place for the troubled teenager to post his negative feelings toward society and instructions on how to make bombs and explosives. The two high school seniors wrote in their personal journals that they wanted to replicate the Oklahoma City Bombing. The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building occurred on April 19, 1995, and killed 168 people









and injured at least 680 people. Since their intention was to kill as many people as possible, they placed bombs and explosives in the school cafeteria during the busiest lunch period. However, the cafeteria bombs failed to detonate. Then, Harris and Klebold began randomly shooting people in their path until they entered the library where students and staff were hiding. Here they proceeded to shoot more people until law enforcement officials arrived. At that point, they took their own lives by shooting themselves.
   The Columbine shootings have cultural significance. First, the amount of news media coverage it received was only second to the O. J. Simpson murder trial (during the 1990s). Second, at that time, it was the most violent act against a school that killed the most people. Third, the two students used the Internet to create websites to post violent acts committed, bomb-building instructions, hit lists, death threats, and videos. Fourth, after the shootings, many schools installed security measures and adopted a zero tolerance policy toward threats of violence. Finally, the Columbine shootings prompted other individuals who felt victimized, bullied, or somehow marginalized to copy Harris and Kle-bold’s rampage shootings. Harris and Klebold posted their strategies on the Internet and provided others with


specific plans on how to carry out an attack. These postings inspired others to imitate the Columbine shooting and seek revenge on people who they felt wronged them. Furthermore, many subsequent shooters attempted to exceed the death toll of the Columbine shooting.
   A sociocultural perspective is taken to understand and make sense of school shootings. The factors considered to have influenced the behavior of Harris and Klebold include bullying, mental illness, video game violence, social climate, Goth subculture, and music. To date, the primary underlying issue for these young men is believed to have been their pain and anger associated with the loss of a place among their peers, in the school community, and in society. An interdisciplinary team effort and a biopsychosocial perspective are both necessary to understand and explain the causes of violence. This team effort includes teachers, school administrators, policy makers, parents, and health-care workers.




Combined treatment is the combination of psychotherapy and medication to treat mental conditions.


• Biopsychosocial refers to biological, psychological, and social factors and their interaction.
• Pharmacological means it relates to pharmacology or the scientific study of drug reactions.
• Pharmacology is the study of drugs, how they react, and their use in medicine.





• Psychopharmacology is the study of psychotropic drugs and their chemical interactions with the brain.
• Psychosocial refers to psychological and social factors and their interaction.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapy and therapeutic counseling.
Combined treatment is the use of psychological treatment with pharmacological treatment. The objective of combined treatment is to improve an individual’s social functioning, quality of life, and treatment outcome. The combination of psychotherapy and medication results in better treatment outcomes for the individual than medication alone. Usually, two clinicians, such as a psychotherapist and a psychiatrist, work collaboratively to develop and implement treatment.
   Combined treatment may work better in the prevention and delay of illness onset than either psychotherapy or medication treatment only. Psychotherapy may increase medication compliance and medication compliance may enhance client focus and engagement in the treatment process. Combined treatment is necessary when one type of treatment, either psychotherapy alone or medication alone, is insufficient to decrease or alleviate symptoms.
   The term “combined treatment” was originally used by psychiatrist Gerald Klerman (1928–1992) in 1991 in the book entitled Integrating Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy. Klerman asserted that combined treatment is more efficacious than either medication or psychotherapy alone because it (1) helps to achieve illness remission faster, (2) improves the probability that treatment will commence, (3) decreases or eliminates the probability of relapse, (4) simultaneously treats the client’s problems while aiding in the reduction of stress among family members, (5) increases medication compliance, (6) develops and/or improves psychosocial skills, and (7) speeds up the psychotherapy process (Beitman and Klerman, 1991, 3–19). Psychotherapy in combination with medication is better than medication


alone for the treatment of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bulimia, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
   The appropriate combination of treatments is determined from a biopsychosocial approach. An individual’s genetic attributes and predispositions, psychological factors, and sociocultural context are considered in the choice of medication and treatment modality (individual, family, and/or group therapy). From a biopsychosocial perspective, a diagnostic map must be constructed to understand and explain the individual’s problems. Then, measurable treatment goals must be identified and assessed throughout the psychotherapy process. Medication, if prescribed, must be monitored and adjusted as necessary. Health practitioners must work collaboratively to determine the sequence and type of combined treatment necessary depending on the diagnosis and its severity. For example, an individual with schizophrenia might receive medication treatment first, followed by individual and family psychotherapy. An individual suffering with psychosis may not be able to take part in any modality of psychotherapy until he or she is properly medicated and psychotic symptoms are managed. Conversely, for individuals with personality disorders, it may be better to begin the combined treatment process with psychotherapy and then include medication to treat symptoms of depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions. Which type of treatment comes first is based on a thorough assessment, professional clinical judgment, and the type and severity of the problem at hand. In addition, clients collaborate with the practitioner in deciding which treatment should be administered and when.









The Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC) is a not-for-profit organization that sets the standard for quality rehabilitation counseling services through a certification program.


• Certification is a formal procedure by which an accredited or authorized person or agency assesses and verifies that a person has the knowledge and skills to perform certain activities.
• Rehabilitation counseling is a type of counseling that focuses on helping individuals who have disabilities in order to achieve their career, personal, and independent living goals.



The Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification ensures that rehabilitation professionals are accountable for the work they do. Rehabilitation counselors work with people with disabilities to provide vocational services. The skills and training required to do this work vary and can be intensive. The work of these counselors may include interviewing and analyzing a client’s disability level to help him or her obtain work and medical and social services. The counselor works to determine what kind of work is appropriate, given the level of disability. When the disabilities are of a catastrophic nature, the rehabilitation counselor may be involved in the full range of life planning for the client.



As the field of rehabilitation counseling grew, it became important to ensure that the counselors had adequate education and skills. The CRCC was founded by two other rehabilitation organizations as a not-for-profit organization established to set standards of quality rehabilitation counseling services. It does this through a standardized certification process for rehab counselors as well as by serving as a lobbying group for the rights of people with disabilities.
   The need to ensure quality counselors was reinforced by the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. The CRCC has continued to identify guidelines for conduct and ethical behavior. This is necessary because the field of rehabilitation counseling has grown exponentially in recent years.
   Inevitably many ethical questions and issues arise in the course of rehabilitation counseling. Rehabilitation counselors have available training in a Code of Professional Ethics for Rehabilitation Counselors in addition to decision-making models to help them resolve ethical dilemmas. CRCC has also been a lobbying group to ensure the support of rehabilitation efforts and standards of practice.

Rehabilitation counseling was identified as one of the fastest-growing health professions in the United States in 2011. The CRCC has become the world’s largest rehabilitation counseling organization, with over 16,000 professionals currently certified. Since its start the CRCC has certified over 35,000 rehabilitation counselors.
   CRCC standards are always in need of review and updating. This includes revising the tests for certification in order to reflect current understanding and best practices of the rehabilitation counselor role and functions. One of the roles of the CRCC is to receive, review, and act on ethical complaints and violations. In the 13 years between 1993 and 2006, 113 complaints were reviewed, of which only 36 resulted in action.
   There will continue to be a significant role for CRCC in the rehabilitation field. Among many other





challenges is an increasingly diverse patient population. This requires changes in laws and guidelines in health care and insurance that are important for people with disabilities. It is also important for the CRCC to be involved in addressing the many ethical challenges for rehabilitation counselors and provide ways to make sure they are providing the best care for their clients.



Common factors in psychotherapy are basic elements that do not depend on a specific theory or psychotherapy approach.


• Behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors.
• Dodo Bird Verdict is the claim that all psychotherapies are equally effective regardless of their components.
• Psychoanalysis is a theory of human behavior and a form of therapy based on psychoanalytic theory. In psychoanalysis, clients are encouraged to talk freely about personal experiences, particularly their early childhood and dreams. It was initially developed by Sigmund Freud.


• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.


Common factors in psychotherapy are basic elements that do not depend on a specific theory or treatment. Throughout history, the followers of different theories have attempted to prove that their theory was superior to others. They argued that their theory led to better outcomes in therapy. For example, those who practice psychoanalysis believed that exploring the past and unconscious drives is necessary for clients to change. Those who practice behavior therapy, however, did not consider these things important and instead focused on behaviors in the present. Currently, there are over 250 different therapeutic approaches. Research has attempted to show which of them is more effective than the others to settle this debate. However, no clear consensus has been reached.
   Several factors are common in most psychotherapy approaches. Many of these factors influence the outcomes of psychotherapy. In 1936, psychologist Saul Rosenzweig (1907–2004) published the first paper outlining common factors in psychotherapy. He concluded that all types of therapy could be effective if therapists had these factors. This was also referred to as the Dodo Bird Verdict in reference to a character’s quote in Alice in Wonderland (“Everybody has won and all must have prizes”). Rosenzweig’s factors included the therapist’s personality and theoretical consistency. Psychologist Carl Rogers (1902–1987) later described the “necessary and sufficient” conditions of therapeutic change in 1957. These were empathy, respect, and genuineness. Rogers argued that therapy was effective simply if these elements were present (sufficient). Psychiatrist Jerome Frank (1909–2005) examined many different types of healing practices ranging from traditional psychotherapy to religion. He found four features shared by all effective therapies. These were a confiding relationship with a therapist, a healing setting, a clear explanation for symptoms and the solution, and a collaborative process or ritual to restore the patient’s health.





   More recent research has continued the investigation into common factors. Psychologist Michael Lambert (1944–) and others reviewed therapeutic outcomes studies. They found that certain factors were responsible for change across different theories and diagnoses and were not connected to a specific theory. They are client variables, the therapeutic relationship, placebo effects, and technique. 

These include such factors as motivation

for change, social support, and inner strengths. This is sometimes referred to as “extratherapeutic” change because it is separate from the therapy. According to Lambert’s analysis, client variables account for 40% of therapy outcome. The therapeutic relationship factor included variables like empathy, respect, and genuineness previously identified by others. This factor takes place between the therapist and the client, also called the therapeutic alliance. Lambert found that this accounted for 30% of the therapy outcome. Placebo effects refer to clients’ degree of hope and expectations for change. Those who believe that positive change will happen are more likely to meet this expectation. Placebo effects account for 15% of therapy outcome according to Lambert. The final common factor is technique. This encompasses features unique to specific theories, such as interpretations or feedback. According to this analysis, 70% of the outcome in therapy is decided by client variables and the therapeutic relationship alone (Lambert, 1992). In other words, therapy will be successful if a client is motivated for change and the therapist has established a strong bond. This formula excludes the specific techniques and theories many thought to be important. Common factors research has led to the development of integrative therapy approaches.


“Community mental health” refers to the delivery of community-based mental health and addictions services to at-risk and underserved populations suffering from mental health conditions and substance use disorders.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is the government agency that provides funding and resources for essential services to underserved populations suffering from mental health conditions and substance use disorders. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is an operating division of the DHHS and is tasked with improving the quality and availability of substance abuse prevention, addiction treatment, and mental health services. SAMHSA provides grants and funding to states for substance abuse and mental health services and programs. A major goal of SAMHSA is to improve access and reduce barrier to programs and services for individuals who suffer from, or are at risk for, substance use disorders or mental health disorders.

President John F. Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Act (CMHA) into law in 1963. The CMHA made a significant impact on the delivery of mental health services and led to the establishment of comprehensive community mental health centers throughout the United States. Prior to the enactment of the CMHA people suffering from chronic mental health conditions were frequently “warehoused” in psychiatric hospitals and institutions. These individuals received little, if any, effective treatment, suffered





from poor living conditions with little freedom, and could remain in these institutions for years with little hope of reentering their communities as productive citizens. With advances in psychotropic medications and the development of new approaches to psychotherapy, community-based care became a viable solution to the warehousing of those suffering from chronic mental health disorders.
   As treatment of mental illness became more diverse and comprehensive, it became evident that those suffering from addictions also needed services. The combination of mental health interventions and interventions directed at recovery from addiction disorders became known as “behavioral health care.” The provision of comprehensive mental health and addiction services is the goal of community-based behavioral health organizations.


Community mental health organizations offer a wide variety of support and services to people with mental illnesses and substance use disorders. Examples of services to communities include 24-hour crisis response and suicide preventing training; community reentry support to released prisoners; educational support to organizations in new mental health and addictions therapies; provision and funding of community-based substance use treatment centers; school-based substance intervention educational programs; domestic violence prevention; child and elder abuse prevention and recovery training; and school and gang violence interventions and programs.
According to the National Council for Behavioral
Health (National Council), there are approximately 8 million adults and children in the United States living with mental illness and substance use conditions who have severely limited or no access to behavioral health services. The National Council is an example of how the DHHS and SAMHSA provide help to the citizens of the United States. The National Council, funded by DHHS and SAMHSA, represents over 2,000-member organizations that employ over 750,000 people providing care to at-risk individuals and families. The National Council advocates for policies to ensure that people with mental health and addictions disorders


have access to comprehensive, high-quality care in order to provide the opportunity for recovery and full participation in community life. The National Council coordinates the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) program, a national mental health initiative.
   In response to gun violence, President Obama called for Mental Health First Aid training across the United States. MHFA is a public education program that teaches community members how to recognize and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders before they become a crisis. MHFA has both youth and adult courses. MHFA consists of eight hours of instruction that introduces participants to the risks factors and warning signs of mental health concerns and links them to local mental health resources, national organizations, support groups and professionals, and online tools. MHFA promotes early detection of specific illnesses such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, eating disorder, and addictions. MHFA training is provided to any concerned citizen or group. The National Council seeks to make Youth Mental Health First Aid available in every one of the 4,197 colleges and 13,809 school districts in the United States.





Community reinforcement approach is a treatment that rearranges an individual’s life so that abstinence and sobriety are more rewarding than substance use. It is also called CRA.


• Abstinence is the choice not to engage in certain behaviors or give in to desires such as alcohol or drug use.
• Aversion therapy uses principles from behavioral psychology to help reduce or eliminate unwanted behaviors.
• Confrontational counseling is an intervention used by counselors to promote wellness in an individual by promoting insight, reducing resistance, promoting open communication, and increasing conformity between an individual’s goals and behaviors.
• Family therapy is a type of psychotherapy approach that is used to help family members resolve conflicts and improve their communication skills.
• Group therapy is a type of psychotherapy approach in which a small group of individuals meet regularly with a therapist.
• Motivational interviewing is a counseling strategy for helping individuals to discover and resolve their ambivalence to change.
• Positive reinforcement is the addition of a reinforcer (reward) following a desired behavior that increases the likelihood that the behavior will reoccur.
• Recovery is a series of steps individuals take to improve their wellness and health, while living a self-directed (responsible) life and striving to reach their highest potential.


• Sobriety is the condition of complete abstinence from all mind-altering substances as well as increased mental, physical, and spiritual health.
• Social support system is feedback and a sense of belonging provided by friends and peers.
• Substance use disorder is a mental disorder in which one or more mind-altering substances lead to clinically significant distress or impairment in an individual.



Community reinforcement approach (CRA) is a substance treatment approach for individuals with substance use disorders. It provides individuals with incentives to stop using by eliminating positive reinforcement for using substances and enhancing positive reinforcement for sobriety. The basic premise is that positive reinforcement has a powerful role in encouraging and discouraging substance use. CRA was developed in the early 1970s by psychologist Nathan Azrin (1930–2013). Azrin stressed the interaction between an individual’s behavior and his or her environment, particularly the positive reinforcement of an individual’s social support system or community. He believed CRA could help individuals decrease their addiction and better enjoy life. CRA uses recreational, social, vocational, and familial reinforcers to help individuals in the recovery process.
   CRA integrates several treatment elements into its program. It helps build motivation to stop drinking and using drugs. It assists in analyzing substance abuse patterns and increasing positive reinforcement for an individual to stop using. It involves learning new coping behaviors and involving friends and family members in the recovery process. These elements can be modified to an individual’s needs in order to achieve the best treatment outcome. In addition, CRA has been successfully integrated with other treatment approaches. Some of these approaches include motivational interviewing, family therapy, group therapy, aversion therapies, and confrontational counseling. The goal of these various approaches is skills training and improving communication and problem solving.





   However, what is unique about CRA is its emphasis on community reinforcement and social support. Individuals with substance use problems, therapists, and friends and family all work together to increase abstinence and sobriety. Having a healthy social support system is a key part of this approach. CRA can be as effective as or more effective than traditional approaches. 




Comorbidity is the presence of an additional mental disorder or medical condition that occurs alongside a mental disorder. It is also referred to as co-occurring illness and dual diagnosis.

Definitions
• Differential diagnosis refers to the presentation of symptoms that appear to meet the criteria of multiple diagnoses and the process of ruling out diagnostic alternatives.
• Dual diagnosis is the presence of a mental disorder and an addiction to alcohol or drugs.
• Pathology is an experience of suffering or aspect of a disease incorporating cause, development, structure, and consequences.
• Personality disorder is a type of mental disorders characterized by deeply ingrained


maladaptive (problematic) patterns of thinking and acting.
• Predisposing factors refer to all the possible factors that account for and explain the client’s characteristic way of perceiving, thinking, and responding.



Comorbidity is the occurrence of one or more mental or medical disorders (conditions) along with a primary mental disorder. Usually, these co-occurring pathologies have similar structure, development, or cause. For example, depression is a common comorbidity following a myocardial infarction (heart attack). However, in medicine “comorbidity” can indicate the simultaneous existence of two or more medical conditions that have different causes, structures, or development. This can lead to confusion about the nature of the multiple diagnoses. For treatment purposes, the interrelationship among the multiple conditions must be taken into account. The reason is that individuals with a diagnosed mental disorder have an increased risk of other diagnoses.
   Several factors foster comorbidity. These include genetic predisposition, family history, environment, and a history of trauma. It is also possible that different unrelated predisposing factors are operative, leading to different unrelated diagnoses. Finally, it is often the case that the symptoms associated with one mental disorder operate as the predisposing factors of one or more other disorders or physical illnesses. Such differing factors that foster comorbidity may exist in isolation or coexist within the same individual. In brief, comorbidity is having more than one diagnosis at any given time.
   Mental health professionals also use the term “comorbidity” when referring to the coexistence of multiple symptoms. This is especially true when a single diagnosis will not account for all client symptoms. The personality of the client is also a factor in comorbidity. Personality traits and coping styles influence the risks associated with developing comorbid mental health disorders. Personality disorder also has a tendency to coexist. It is not uncommon for a client





diagnosed with a personality disorder to have features of another personality disorder. In fact, more than half of individuals with personality disorders will be diagnosed with a comorbid personality disorder. Mood disorders and anxiety disorders also have a high rate of comorbidity. The substance disorders often have comorbid mental disorders and/or physical illnesses. The term “dual diagnosis” is especially common when indicating the coexistence of substance-related disorders and other mental disorders. For example, depression is common in individuals with alcohol dependence.
   Current research indicates inconsistent use of the term “comorbidity.” The primary importance is for the clinician to account for all of the client’s problems. It is possible to exclude some of the client’s problems if the clinician focuses on only one diagnosis. In this case, comorbidity is related to the term “differential diagnosis.” Where the determination of differential diagnosis or process of diagnostic elimination cannot be fully made, the possibility of comorbidity increases.

Alvin Feinstein (1925–2001) introduced the term “comorbidity” to medicine in 1970. In the 1990s, researchers identified two major types of comorbidity. “Homotypic comorbidity” refers to the coexistence of two or more diagnoses of the same diagnostic category. “Heterotypic comorbidity” refers to the coexistence of two or more diagnoses of different diagnostic categories. As researchers began to investigate comorbidity, questions arose as to the nature of the relationship between or among coexisting pathologies. A theory of a direct causal relationship was proposed, such that the presence of one disorder causes the presence of another disorder or illness. Another theory of the relationship between comorbid disorders that developed is the theory of the indirect causal relationship. The indirect causal relationship indicates that the presence of one diagnosis increases the likelihood of a second diagnosis. A third theory that developed out of the research on comorbidity is that of common factors. The comorbidity theory of common factors indicates that multiple diagnoses have the same set of predisposing factors.





“Compassion fatigue” refers to the emotional strain and stress experienced by a variety of health-care professionals working with victims of traumatic events.


Compassion fatigue, also known as secondary traumatic stress, is a stress condition that some helping professionals experience after working with people who have experienced traumatic events. It is the result of the accumulated emotional and psychological impact of repeated exposure to the traumatic experiences of others. It has been referred to as the “cost of caring” and is experienced by a wide variety of health-care professionals, including counselors, psychologists, social workers, nurses, doctors, emergency room workers, and other care providers. It has also been found to affect clergy, lawyers, firefighters, and other emergency responders. It is estimated that between 16% and 85% of care providers experience compassion fatigue. Compassion fatigue was first recognized in the 1990s and continues to be the focus of research and investigation across professional fields. Charles Figley is recognized for his extensive research and publications concerning compassion fatigue.






Caregivers who treat trauma victims and listen to repeated stories of tragedy, violence, sorrow, pain, sadness, fear, terror, loss, and death experience compassion fatigue, also referred to as vicarious traumatization. These repeated stories begin to have an affect on the caregiver, and the caregiver experiences what is referred to as secondary traumatic stress.
   The effects of compassion fatigue impact helping professionals’ emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. They may begin to remember their client’s stories during their nonwork hours and may visualize the stories in their mind’s eye. Sometimes these images are intrusive and caregivers can’t seem to stop thinking about the events even though they did not have the experience themselves. They may experience some of the feelings associated with their client’s story. They may become sad or depressed, emotionally detached, anxious, or fearful or experience other feelings their clients or patients experienced. Caregivers may experience physical difficulties such as difficulty sleeping, headaches, or stomach problems. Professionals working with victims of violent crime may become obsessed with fears of their own safety and may avoid places that remind them of the client’s experience. Caregivers who work with children may become overprotective of their own children. It is not uncommon for compassion fatigue to result in a change in worldview and beliefs. Caregivers suffering from compassion fatigue may begin to question the meaning of life, question their own religious beliefs, become skeptical, or feel anger toward God.


Research indicates that certain risk factors exist for the development of compassion fatigue. Exposure is a significant factor. Caregivers who are exposed to traumatic stories on a daily basis are at greater risk of secondary trauma than are those who are exposed less often. It has also been found that those who are more empathic are at greater risk for compassion fatigue. Other risk factors include ability to self-care, coping abilities and stress management, work and peer support, and spirituality.


   Compassion fatigue is preventable and treatable. Perhaps the most important strategy to prevent secondary traumatic stress is self-care, which begins with awareness. Professionals who understand compassion fatigue are more likely to recognize the signs of fatigue before they become problematic. Self-care practices such as pursuing enjoyable activities like sports or hobbies, regular exercise, and social activities apart from work are important to a balanced lifestyle that can provide recovery and perspective when working with traumatized clients. It is very important that professionals debrief and talk with other professionals in a supportive role. When compassion fatigue becomes debilitative, psychotherapy has been shown to be effective in the recovery process.


Competency and Competencies

Within the context of health care, competency is the ability to integrate knowledge, skills, and attitudes to provide high-quality care. Competencies are the specific knowledge, skill, and attitudes by which competency can be evaluated.


• American Counseling Association is a not-for-profit, professional, and educational organization that is dedicated to the growth and enhancement of the counseling profession. It is also referred to as the ACA.
• American Psychological Association is the largest professional organization in the United States and Canada. It publishes the





Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association and is also referred to as the APA.
• Counseling refers to professional guidance of an individual by assisting him or her in resolving personal, social, or psychological problems and difficulties.
• Countertransference is the redirection of a therapist’s feelings toward a client and more generally as a therapist becomes emotionally entangled with a client.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior.
• Transference is a phenomenon characterized by unconscious redirection of feelings from one individual to another.


Competency in the field of counseling is the judicious and continuous use of skills, knowledge, emotions, values, clinical reasoning, and reflection in health care. This includes counseling and psychotherapy. The term “competency” was coined by an American psychologist, R. W. White (1904–2001), in 1959. It involves a wide range of professional and personal capacities related to an external standard or requirement. For example, the capacity for analysis, critical thinking, and professional judgment in evaluating a situation and making clinical decisions is based on the competence of a counselor. Because the issues that individuals bring to counseling are often complex, it can be difficult for counselors to effectively treat them. Thus, counselors with a high level of competency are more likely to be effective and successful than those with less competency. It is not surprising that both the American Counseling Association and the American Psychological Association expect competency of its members.
“Competencies” refer to specific knowledge, skill,
attitudes, and their integration. Competency can be evaluated in terms of specific competencies. The American psychologist David McClelland (1917–1998) is


considered to be the father of the competency movement. There has been a shift in professional training from a core curriculum model to a core competency model of learning (Sperry, 2010). Sperry has identified and described six core competencies in counseling and psychotherapy. These competencies include having a conceptual foundation, relationship building and maintenance, intervention planning, intervention implementation, intervention evaluation and termination, and being culturally and ethically sensitive in practice (Sperry, 2010).
   The conceptual foundation provides a conceptual map that will help guide a therapist in determining which clinical data to observe and elicit and how to understand the data. Competent therapy also requires a strong therapeutic relationship between the therapist (counselor) and the client. A strong therapeutic relationship is important because it promotes a bond of trust between the therapist and client and encourages an agreement about the goals for the treatment process. There are two competencies in relationship building. They include establishing a therapeutic alliance and the ability to encourage treatment-promoting behaviors. There are three competencies included in maintaining a therapeutic relationship. One involves being aware of and resolving resistance and having mixed feelings (ambivalence) about something. In addition, being aware of and resolving therapeutic tensions and being aware of and fixing transference and countertransference issues are another aspect to maintaining a therapeutic relationship. Implementation of the intervention process is a part of the core competency model of learning. Therapists who use techniques that focus on intended goals are likely to become proficient in this competency. Intervention planning is a part of the core competency model. It includes accomplishing a comprehensive diagnostic assessment, assigning a DSM-V diagnosis, creating a successful case formulation and treatment plan, and combining a clinical case report. Implementation of an intervention is performed by using modalities and techniques that focus on intended goals that will be helpful in becoming proficient in this competency. Competent counseling requires the capacity for assessing treatment and getting ready for terminating a client. Continually observing a client is vital in order to assess the treatment progress. Lastly,





competent therapy insists that the therapist practice in an ethically and culturally sensitive way. Furthermore, cultural competence may help to promote a strong therapeutic alliance.


Compliance is the extent to which an individual follows a prescribed treatment regimen. A related term is “adherence.”


• Adherence involves taking an active role in collaborating with a health provider and treatment regimen.
• Noncompliance is the failure, in whole or part, to follow a prescribed treatment regimen.
• Treatment regimen is a specified course of treatment for a medical or psychological condition.

“Compliance” is defined as the extent to which an individual’s behavior, such as taking medications, keeping scheduled medical appointments, or making lifestyle changes, coincides with his or her prescribed treatment


regimen. Patient treatment noncompliance is one of the most vexing challenges facing health-care providers. Noncompliance with medical treatment is very common, ranging from 50% to 75% (Brown and Bussell, 2011). Estimates are that only one-fourth of individuals with hypertension (high blood pressure) are getting medical treatment. Of those, about one-half of those have normal blood pressure readings because only two-thirds use medication as prescribed. In 2006 it was reported that more than 125,000 patients with treatable ailments die each year in the United States because of failure to take their medication properly (American College of Preventive Medicine, 2011). The reality is that most patients find it difficult to take medications as prescribed or make major lifestyle changes consistently over long periods of time.
   Compliance and adherence are often used synonymously, but they are different. Compliance literally means complying with (following) the health-care provider’s recommended treatment regimen. Compliance implies a paternalistic role for the provider and a passive role for the patient. In contrast, adherence means that the patient is adhering to the treatment regimen. Adherence implies that the patient is empowered to take a reasonable degree of responsibility for his or her own health. It also implies that the patient and provider collaborate to improve the patient’s health by integrating the provider’s professional opinion with the patient’s lifestyle, values, and preferences for care. More specifically, adherence depends not only on patient’s acceptance of information about the health condition itself but also on the provider’s ability to persuade the patient that the prescribed treatment is worthwhile. It also depends on the individual’s perception of the provider’s credibility, empathy, interest, and concern.

A medical dictum is particularly relevant to any discussion of compliance. “Drugs don’t work in patients who don’t take them.” So why don’t patients comply or adhere? Early research on compliance emphasized the treatment regimen and health provider instructions, and later focused on client perception of his or her illness and expectations of treatment. In the 1990s the focus of adherence research was on the





patient–provider relationship and how to improve it. Today, efforts have shifted to increasing the family’s influence on compliance.



Compulsions are habitual behaviors, practices, or rituals that are impulsively engaged in to defend against perceived threats, to reduce fears or otherwise minimize distress.


• Comorbidity is the existence of one or more mental disorders or physical illnesses that occur with a primary psychiatric illness. It is also referred to as dual diagnosis.
• Evidence-based practice is a form of practice that is based on integration of the best research evidence with clinical experience and client values.
• Obsessions are persistent, intrusive, inappropriate, and unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that result in anxiety or distress.


• Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental disorder that is distressful to the individual and is characterized by unreasonable obsessions or compulsions that are inappropriately time consuming or cause marked distress or impairment.
• Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a personality disorder that is defined by a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with control, perfectionism, and meticulousness at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency.
• Pathology is an experience of suffering or aspect of a disease incorporating cause, development, structure, and consequences.
• Practice is a method or process used to accomplish a goal or objective.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Theoretical integration is the assimilation of two or more theories of psychotherapy.


Compulsions are habitual behaviors, practices, or rituals that are intended to defend against distress. Obtaining pleasure or gratification is not the primary function of compulsions. A client suffering from compulsivity feels compelled to execute the compulsion. The client feels driven to defend themselves against perceived threats, driven to reduce their anxiety, or driven to minimize their distress. Common compulsive behaviors are hand washing, ordering, checking, hoarding, and requesting or demanding reassurance. Common compulsive mental practices or rituals include praying, counting, and the silent repetition of a word or phrase. Individuals suffering from compulsions are constantly doing and undoing. Compulsions are born out of an individual’s desire to avoid the “out-of-control” feeling created by anxieties, perceived threats, and other forms of distress. Compulsions are typically related to an individual’s reactive





and unwanted emotional response toward an authority that he or she feels forced to be submissive to. The client’s reactive emotions are often connected with rebellion, aggression, greed, destructiveness, or disorderliness. Because these emotions are believed by the individual to be unacceptable or dangerous, he or she unwittingly develops compulsions to protect against feeling the reactive emotions. Compulsions are protective psychological defensive mechanisms that prevent unwanted feeling states.
   Clients performing defensive compulsions are aware of the fact that their compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. Further, the habitual behavior, practice, or ritual is clearly inappropriate. In fact, compulsions are not at all rationally associated with the perceived threat, anxiety, or distress they are designed to inhibit. Compulsions persist as a result of the tremendous anxiety or distress that is generated through attempts to resist engaging in the compulsion. Clients find relief in yielding to the compulsion and attempt to integrate them into their daily lifestyles. This lifestyle integration may be relatively successful and of little consequence to the individual. In this case compulsions are not pathological. However, it is probable that compulsions will lead to marked distress and require psychotherapy to overcome. Pathological compulsions can be very time consuming and significantly interfere with the client’s desired lifestyle. Clients’ routines may be interrupted by compulsions. Compulsions may interfere with occupational or academic functioning and impede upon social activities and engagement in meaningful relationships.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association has differentiated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) from obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) since its third revision (DSM-III). Subsequent editions, including DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, and DSM-5, maintain the important distinctions between OCD and OCPD. These two distinct mental disorders are rarely comorbid (occurring together). OCD and OCPD are not variations of the


same disorder. Compulsions are a feature of OCD but are not of OCPD.
   However, the history of term compulsion does not begin with the DSM-III. Medical practitioners in the medieval period utilized the Latin term compulsio to talk about compulsions. Many years later, Jean Etienne Dominique Esquirol (1782–1840) opened a clinic for the treatment of involuntary, irresistible, and instinctive activity. In the 1850s French psychiatrists were calling compulsions “insanity with insight” (folie avec conscience) and deemed the condition a weakness of willpower. Bénédict Augustin Morel (1809–1873) reclassified OCD from a form of insanity to a disease of the emotions (neurosis). Morel’s contribution to OCD laid the groundwork for the modern DSM definition. Freud (1856–1939) also recognized OCD but described it as essentially the same disorder as the OCPD. Needless to say, Freud created unnecessary confusion, which persists even today among some clinicians. Psychological conceptualizations of (ways of thinking about) compulsions evolved from volitional to emotive to intellectual. Until the publication of the DSM-III there was a common belief that pathological personality dynamics caused or triggered compulsions. As noted previously, OCPD was officially distinguished from OCD in 1980.





Computed tomography (CT) is a medical diagnostic test in which computer-processed X-rays produce tomographs (cross-sectional images) of body areas. It is also referred to as X-ray computed tomography and computed axial tomography (CAT scan).


• Magnetic resonance imaging is a diagnostic imaging device that uses electromagnetic radiation and a strong magnetic field to produce images of soft tissues.
• Positron emission tomography is a diagnostic imaging technique that uses radioactive substances to produce three-dimensional colored images within the body.


Computed tomography (CT scan) is a medical imaging procedure that utilizes computer-processed X-rays to produce tomographic images (“slices”) of specific areas of the body. These cross-sectional images are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines. Digital geometry processing (computer software) is used to generate a three-dimensional image of the inside of an object from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images.
   CT scans are relatively inexpensive compared to magnetic resonance imaging scans and positron emission tomography. CT is a commonly used diagnostic tool that supplements some standard X-ray studies, like the chest X-ray, while it has replaced others. For example, the CT is used to identify tumors, cysts, or infections that may be suspected on a chest X-ray. CT scans of the abdomen are useful in defining body organ anatomy, including visualizing the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, aorta, kidneys, uterus, and ovaries. Such scans can verify the presence or absence of tumors, infection, abnormal anatomy, or changes caused by trauma.



Computed tomography (CT) is a medical diagnostic test in which computer-processed x-rays produce tomographs (cross-sectional images) of body areas, including the brain. (Dave Bredeson/Dreamstime.com)



The CT was invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield in England at EMI Central Research Laboratories using X-rays. It was originally known as the “EMI scan” because it was developed at a research branch of EMI. However, EMI is more widely known today for its music and recording business. The first EMI brain scan was done in October, 1971. Soon after, it became known as computed axial tomography and body section röentgenography. Only much later did it become known as the CT scan.
   CT produces considerable diagnostic data that can be formatted, through a process known as “windowing,” to demonstrate various bodily structures based on their ability to block the X-ray beam. In the past, CT images were represented only in the axial (vertical) or transverse (horizontal) plane. Now, CT





images can be represented in various planes, including a volumetric (three-dimensional) representation of body structures.
   CT scans have greatly improved the ability of physicians to diagnose many medical conditions earlier in their course and with much less risk than previous diagnostic methods. Further refinements in CT scan technology promise even better picture quality and patient safety. CT scans known as “spiral” or “helical” CT scans are able to provide more rapid and accurate visualization of internal organs. For instance, many trauma centers are using these scans to more rapidly diagnose internal injuries after serious body trauma. High-resolution CT scans are used to accurately assess the lungs for inflammation and scarring. CT angiography is a newer technique that allows noninvasive imaging of the coronary arteries.


Computers play such an integral role in society that it should come as no surprise that clinicians and psychologists rely heavily on computer-based testing in their evaluation, analysis, and research. In particular, psychologists and researchers alike use computer-based testing programs to standardize testing for personality and actuarial studies. Such computer-based testing also determines an individual’s strengths in terms of academics and provides statistical analysis that may lead to indications of a mental health diagnosis.


• Computer-based testing is a form of automated psychological assessment that uses computer software programs to interpret, analyze, and even administer testing procedures. A broader definition of computer-based testing can also include Internet-based assessments, whereby subjects respond through an online medium.


Computer-based testing is not a new phenomenon. Mental health professionals have been using computers for psychological assessment for more than 50 years. Interestingly, computer-based testing as a whole has not changed significantly since the Mayo Clinic released its first computer-based psychological assessment in 1962.
   Today, computer-based testing is used in countless psychological studies. Clinicians use this form of testing in nearly every type of personality test. Popular psychological assessments include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (or “MMPI-2”), the MMPI-2-RF, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.
   This type of computer-based testing provides many advantages, including the fact that it’s more cost effective than traditional testing methods of paper and pencil. It’s also easier to score when a computer evaluates test results. In addition, computer-based testing allows for broad-based statistical analysis of the results once the test is completed. Perhaps, most important, as society becomes more computer literate, clinicians are finding that test subjects prefer to use computer-based testing than the traditional pencil and paper tests.
   Studies indicate that test subjects are more open, honest, and forthcoming when answering personality and other questions through a computer-based test compared to a test with paper and pencil. They have also found that test subjects are more likely to respond candidly to sensitive questions in computer-based testing





as opposed to traditional, clinician-administered testing methods.
   Certain computer-based testing has also evolved to adapt to the individual taking the test. This gives a more precise evaluation of a person’s abilities when the computer-based test is tailored to his or her level of knowledge and expertise. While there are many benefits to these computer-based tests, psychologists also warn there are potential disadvantages.

One of the main issues with these automated tests is their validity. Researchers and psychologists are concerned that such tests may exhibit a certain bias—based on the person administering the test and his or her level of expertise. Another potential disadvantage is the collaboration between the clinician and the computer programmer who designs the test. Some clinicians are concerned that a lack of communication can lead to errors in the programming. However, expert clinicians have called for certain guidelines and standards for computer-based testing to help address these issues. As a whole, clinicians and researchers embrace computer-based testing. By all accounts, this type of testing will be even more critical in the years to come.


Conditioned Reflexes: An Investigation of the Physiological Activity of the Cerebral Cortex (Book)

Conditioned Reflexes is a book about how behavior is influenced by the brain. It was written by Ivan Pavlov and discusses his experiments on dogs. It was first published in 1927.


• Behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors.
• Classical conditioning is a process in which a previously neutral stimulus comes to evoke a specific response by being repeatedly paired with another stimulus that evokes the response. In Pavlov’s experiments, food was the unconditioned stimulus that produced salivation in the dog—called a reflex or unconditioned response. The bell was the conditioned stimulus, which eventually produced salivation in the absence of food. This salivation was the conditioned response.
• Conditioning is a process of changing behavior with a reward or punishment each time an action is performed.
• Reflex is the name Pavlov gave to the unconditioned response.
• Stimulus is something that triggers a physical or psychological response. The plural is stimuli.



Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936) wrote the book Conditioned Reflexes: An Investigation of the Physiological Activity of the Cerebral Cortex. He was a Russian physiologist who studied animals. His research focused on the brain and how it influenced behavior. Pavlov initially believed that animals and humans were simply machines who responded to their environment in predicable





ways. His early experiments involved exposing dogs to different stimuli before giving them food and measured the quantity of their saliva. The stimuli ranged from sounds to pictures and touch. When the food was




Conduct Disorder

removed, Pavlov found that the dogs still salivated		
when exposed to the stimulus. They had been conditioned to respond to the stimulus as if it were food. He concluded that the connection between the brain and behavior could be manipulated. This manipulation came to be called classical conditioning. The popular image of Pavlov’s dogs drooling to the ringing of a bell comes from ideas introduced in this book.
   Pavlov concluded that there are two types of reflexes. Unconditioned reflexes happen naturally, such as when a dog sees food and salivates. Conditioned reflexes are created through learning, such as when a dog salivates to nonfood stimuli. He discovered that the cerebral cortex (outer part of the brain) was responsible for this. He concluded that nerve pathways within this part of the brain can be changed through learning. It is as if learning “rewires” the brain. Pavlov also found that there were limits to this conditioning. If the brain was given too much to process, it would not change. In addition, new behaviors sometimes wore off over time if they were not reinforced.
   Pavlov wrote in this book that all living things respond to their environments through this process of learning in the brain. More advanced organisms like human beings have more complex ways of learning. He viewed humans as different from other animals because they have more conditioned responses than natural ones. Pavlov believed that human civilization was created as a way to manage reflexes. For example, individuals are trained and educated by going to school. They learn about the world around them, how to follow rules, and how to appropriately interact with others. Pavlov also viewed conditioning as changeable. His research had a significant influence on the psychology, in general, and behavior therapy, in particular.

Dating back centuries, parents and professionals alike have agonized over how to help children who are seemingly out of control, making conduct disorder among the oldest diagnostic categories currently used by modern-day child psychiatry.
   In the early 1900s, one of the pioneers who found success in working with conduct disordered children was August Aichhorn, who left his teaching career at the age of 44 and went to study psychoanalysis under Sigmund Freud. Aichhorn felt that children who had stalled in their development were at risk for later antisocial behavior. He also believed that the cause of these challenges could frequently be traced back to difficulties in the parent–child relationship. Studies suggest that many children diagnosed with conduct disorder later go on to develop antisocial personality disorder.
   With support and encouragement from Anna Freud, August Aichhorn is considered among the first to have worked successfully with troubled adolescents. His success came from making modifications to Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic approach with neurotics. Aichhorn used psychoanalysis in combination with his keen understanding of personality to find positive results in working with juvenile delinquents.

• Conduct disorder is a psychological disorder described in the DSM 5 as having pervasive patterns of behavior that infringe on the rights of others or that violate social norms. These include aggressive, rule breaking, rebellion, and other destructive behaviors. The majority of individuals diagnosed with conduct disorder previously were first diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder. Conduct disorder is believed to be a precursor to antisocial personality disorder. There are also links to ADHD, substance use, and learning disabilities, which commonly are present





in a child or adolescent diagnosed with conduct disorder.

There are two distinct subtypes of conduct disorder, including one with onset in childhood with at least one of the criteria being met before the age of 10 and the second being an onset in adolescence, which requires an absence of any criteria being present before the age of 10. The childhood onset type of conduct disorder includes children who frequently display higher levels of ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) symptoms, family problems, and academic challenges, as well as more aggressive behavior. The adolescent onset type usually has a better long-term prognosis compared to the childhood onset type.
   Notably, there seems to be a link between oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Specifically, it has been found that the majority of children who have been diagnosed with conduct disorder were previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder. Moreover, a fair number of individuals who have been diagnosed with conduct disorder later go on to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.
   Some of the criteria for conduct disorder include aggression to people and animals (e.g., bullying, fighting, or cruelty to people or animals), destruction of property (e.g., fire setting, damage to property), deceitfulness or theft (e.g., breaking into someone’s home or car, or lying), and disregard for rules (staying out late, running away, skipping school). Several risk factors have been identified for conduct disorder, including smoking during pregnancy, low socioeconomic status or poverty, parental misbehavior (drug use, criminal behavior), a poor family environment (unstable, single-parent homes), and exposure to physical or sexual abuse. Treatment of conduct disorder usually requires family therapy, behavior management, and pharmacotherapy.




Conflict resolution, sometimes used interchangeably with “dispute resolution,” describes a peaceful process or approach that is used to settle disputes, arguments, or conflicts between two opposing parties.


• Compromise defines when opposing parties move toward one another, finding common ground in order to come to some resolution, understanding, or agreed-upon solution.
• Conflict management describes an ongoing process of mediating disputes between





two parties where a resolution, though sought after, may not be reached.
• Mediation is a process in which one objective party facilitates agreement, understanding, or resolution between two opposing parties.
• Reconciliation, a term that often has a religious connotation, describes the act of bringing back together two conflicting parties once agreement has been reached and often after some form of retribution has been made.


Conflict resolution is a process used to facilitate peace or understanding between two or more social entities (individuals, groups, organizations, nations). Win–win solutions in which both sides feel that they have been heard and understood, and that their concerns have been addressed, are sought. Conflict resolution utilizes specific communication skills, including active listening, expression of feelings, empathic responding, open-ended questioning, and problem-solving techniques.
   Conflict is an inevitable part of everyday human interaction that can arise from differences in perceptions, feelings, perspectives, interests, or approaches. It is centered in the belief that if one party gets what it wants, then the other party will not be able to do so. When conflict is not dealt with effectively, it can result in feelings of resentment and hurt or damage to relationships. However, when conflict is dealt with in a positive, respectful way, it can alleviate stress, foster acceptance, and even strengthen a relationship. Ownership for resolving conflict is the responsibility of both parties equally. Both need to find common ground, come together, hear one another out, increase understanding, and agree to concede on certain points.
   Conflict resolution as a method, though it may vary in language and sequence, has some basic essential components. An initial component required, which can help alleviate tension for those involved, is for each person to recognize, acknowledge, and be able to regulate their emotions. In addition, both parties should have a clear understanding of their own needs. Further progress can be made if the parties are


able to effectively communicate their needs to the one another. One must pay attention to what is communicated both verbally and nonverbally. Those involved should remain calm and refrain from attacking one another with either words or actions. Respecting differing backgrounds, perspectives, and views is key. If these components are incorporated, then each person is more likely to be willing to compromise, with the ultimate goal being to find some common ground.


Conflict resolution arose as a defined field of study in the 1950s and 1960s during the Cold War era when fear of nuclear threat was a dominant theme. Scientists began to study conflict and apply similar principles to global problems and national relations, as well as to specific tensions between communities, groups, and individuals. Relations between national superpowers improved during the 1980s and 1990s with the downfall of the Soviet Union. However, tensions between the United States and Middle East have been ongoing since the turn of the century and continue to be of concern. Wars, movements, and threats have all resulted from conflict with varying outcomes. Often conflict between nations, organizations, and groups can result in an increased sense of unity among members of each particular groups. Foundational theorist in the field, Morton Deustch, was the first to define between what he termed “constructive” and “destructive” types of conflict. Other influential writers on the topic, Kenneth Thomas and Ralph Kilman, identified five styles of dealing with conflict during the 1970s: competitive, collaborative, compromising, accommodating, and avoiding. They argued that most people have a preferred conflict resolution style but can learn to respond with differing styles depending on varying situations. Several other models, theories, and approaches have followed with similar terminology, sequences, and themes.


The study of conflict resolution is an expanding field both from a scientific perspective and in terms of professional practice. This topic has been studied among





countries, government agencies, educational institutions, communities, families, and between individual people. A new area of focus has been on understanding the particular worldviews of each party, remaining multiculturally sensitive and respectful to both. This approach can resolve conflicts more efficiently and effectively.



Conjoint family therapy is a form of psychotherapy developed by Virginia Satir (1916–1988), who is affectionately referred to as the mother of family therapy. Conjoint family therapy uses a comprehensive approach to working with families as a whole system as opposed to working with individuals within the family.
   In conjoint family therapy, all family members are seen simultaneously. There must be an alliance between not only the therapist but also within the family unit as well to have a successful outcome. Family members must agree on treatment goals and be willing to work together and confront each other when necessary. Satir believed that oftentimes the presenting issue was not the core problem within a family system but rather the family’s way of coping with the underlying problem.



• Conjoint family therapy is a family counseling theory in which a therapist sees a family and addresses the issues and problems raised by the family members as a system rather than addressing the problems being experienced by individual members of the family.


Satir believed that maintaining self-esteem is a primary motivation of individuals and she believed that low self-esteem could lead to significant challenges in interpersonal relationships. Therefore, a family can achieve homeostasis of roles from efforts from each individual to maintain self-esteem. A change in an individual must also incorporate changes from each family member. This is accomplished through conjoint interviews.
   In conjoint family therapy, the therapist examines the family rules, roles, and communication. The therapist focuses on group or subgroup actions within the family as opposed to just one individual in the family. Focus on an individual within the family could occur as part of this approach, but it had to be tied back into the context of the family.
   Family therapy can be difficult if each member disagrees about what the problem is, what the treatment goals are, or the purpose of therapy. For there to be a successful outcome, each member must be an active participant and invest in the process and each other. The conjoint family therapy model also requires family members to be willing to take risks with each other. To achieve this, therapists must not only be building the therapeutic alliance but also the working alliance between the family members.
   It is important that the therapist be in tune with potential ruptures within the family unit and the working alliance as a whole. Ruptures within conjoint family therapy are more complex. They can occur if one family member attempts to force another to participate making that person more likely to resent treatment as a whole. The therapist has to be sure he or she does not show any preferential treatment toward one family





member over another. There must be a balance of alliances to work toward successful outcomes.

Clinical observation and treatment of the whole family emerged in the 20th century. Interest in the family unit developed from working with individuals and seeing potential connections and impacts. The person who initially sought treatment, or rather the identified patient, was not necessarily the only one affected by problems within the family.
   In the mid-1900s there was an emergence of three major forms of family therapy. Conjoint family therapy was the third one, which at the time was growing in popularity. One of the most important contributions of conjoint family therapy was that it led to looking at the family group as a system rather than just a single member of the family who was singled out as the identified patient.
   As with any form of therapy, the working alliance is a key component. Virginia Satir played a key role in the development of family therapy and in working within family systems. One of her most well-known books is Conjoint Family Therapy: A Guide to Theory and Technique, as well as Peoplemaking.

Conjoint sexual therapy is a treatment conducted together for relationship partners, which focuses on aspects of their sexual issues and problems.


• Sexual dysfunctions disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant difficulty in the ability to respond sexually or to experience sexual pleasure. Disorders include delayed ejaculation, female orgasmic disorder, and genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.

The term and practice of conjoint sexual therapy came out of the research conducted by Masters and Johnson and published in their 1970 book Human Sexual Inadequacy. Conjoint therapy, in general, is behavior-based psychological treatment conducted with individuals together and in the same session. The goal is to help them deal with issues that negatively impact them. Behavior based in this context means that the therapy is not aimed at discovering why the problem exists but rather at dealing with its effects and consequences. For conjoint sexual therapy, sexual exercises and behaviors are often recommended as part of treatment.
   In conjoint sexual therapy for sexual partners, the sexual issues or dysfunctions are treated as a separate entity. These include sexual dysfunction disorders such as arousal and orgasmic conditions. The belief is that the sexual problems themselves are the client. This means that issues are seen not as separate problems or individual, his or her, problems. Instead, they are viewed as part of the dynamic of the relationship that both partners share. This is true when the issues may have been problems like erectile dysfunction for the man or painful vaginal experience during intercourse for the woman. In this view, all sexual experiences are shared between partners and they must be worked on in that context for the treatment to be successful.






While there is no question that Masters and Johnson were pioneers in conjoint sexual therapy, the treatment methods and approaches they used were ones that had been available for many years. Techniques described as sensate focus exercises were the basis of their treatment approach. Their aim was to broaden the sexual experience, to reduce anxiety around sexual performance, and to enable couples to enjoy the sexual experience. In all of this they were groundbreaking because they treated men and women as equal in their ability to enter into and enjoy the sexual experience.
   Another important researcher in conjoint sexual therapy was Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan. She found that success in an outpatient setting required a slightly different approach. She added psychodynamic therapy and other approaches to increase the likelihood of success for her clients. Both Masters and Johnson and Kaplan were controversial in aspects of their suggestions, which included interventions such as sexual desensitization, masturbation, and sexual surrogates.


Although there are many individual success stories from conjoint sexual therapy, it has remained difficult to show consistent experimental results. This makes sense because similar sexual problems may have a variety of physical and psychological causes. It is still a challenge to decide which approach is best for which clients and under what circumstances.
   Nevertheless, conjoint sexual therapy remains a treatment of choice for couples who struggle with sexual relationship problems. Most therapists employ a variety of interventions to reduce fear around sexuality, enhance communication and enjoyment, and help people in general to have improved relationships. The aim in current therapeutic approaches is not just to improve sexual functioning but to enhance the partners in their relationship with one another.

Conners Rating Scales (CRS) are normed behavior rating scales used by mental health professionals to screen and assist in diagnosing attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children.

• Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), is a behavioral diagnosis used to describe a combination of problems, including difficulty sustaining attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.
• Rating scales are semi-objective assessment tools that require individuals completing them to assign a quantitative judgment to their observations of certain behaviors.



Conners Rating Scales are rating forms, completed by parents, teachers, and sometimes self, to determine the presence of behavior issues specifically related to inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These general screening tools were initially developed to assist in the identification of these types of problems in children; however, they have recently been expanded to use with adults. The most recent version advertises use with ages 6 to 18 (parent and teacher). Psychologist C. Keith Conners published





the first of these rating scales in 1964, with follow-up editions in 1989 (Conners Rating Scales-CSR), 1997 (Conners Rating Scales-Revised—CSR-R), and 2008 (Conners 3—C3).
   Both long and short versions of the CRS are easy to administer and score. They can be scored by hand or with the accompanying computer software. Number of items vary from version to version, with the most recent, the Conners 3, containing the following: Teacher (long-115; short-39), Parent (long-110; short-43), Self (long-59; short-39). Short version use is recommended for progress monitoring purposes, when one is planning multiple administrations over a period of time. Administration takes approximately 20 minutes for the long version and 10 minutes for the short, but there is no time limit. The Parent and Teacher surveys are written on a fifth-grade reading level and the Self-Report on a third-grade reading level. Both English and Spanish translations are available. The Conners 3 is comprised of six scales: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, Executive Functioning, Learning Problems, Aggression, Peer Relations, and Family Relations.
   The forms are multipaged, carbon copies. Responses circled on the front or back are automatically transferred to a middle section for use by the scorer. The scorer transfers the circled scores into appropriate scales on the middle form and totals each scale at the bottom of the page. After transferring the raw scores to the various scales and totaling them, the total of each scale (A–N) is transferred to another form which represents the findings graphically. The scorer must be careful to transpose the raw scores to the correct age group column within each major scale. Each of these column scores can then be converted to a T-score and then to percentile scores as needed. T-scores above 60 are cause for concern and have interpretive value. Interpretable scores range from a low T-score of 61 (mildly atypical) to above 70 (markedly atypical).


The Conners Rating Scales were initially designed as a comprehensive checklist to identify common behavior problems in children. In the late 1990s, a


restandardization of the scales took place, attempting to focus more narrowly on behaviors associated with ADHD. This revision, the CRS-R, was also empirically based and normed on a large, representative sample of North American children. The most recently published version, the Conners 3, includes normative data for 1,200 parents, 1,200 teachers, and 1,000 self-report raters and is matched to the 2000 U.S. Census information on ethnicity/race, gender, and parent education level. Separate norms are provided for males and females in one-year intervals.


Debate over the reliability and validity of these assessment tools has been an issue. Therefore, CRS should be used only as part of comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation. They should not be used in isolation to diagnose ADHD symptomatology as there is risk of obtaining false positives (diagnosing when criteria are not present) or false negatives (not diagnosing when the criteria are present). Though theses scales are easy to administer and score, they should be interpreted only by a trained professional. Early versions on the CRS were also criticized for the disparity between results obtained by different ethnic groups, but this has been addressed in the latest revisions.






Contemplative neuroscience is the study of how contemplative practices such as meditation affect the brain and the nervous system.


• Contemplation is studying or observing something carefully or thinking deeply about it.
• Contemplative practices are activities that foster contemplation, such as meditation, reflection, prayer, journaling, and worship.
• Meditation is the concentrated focus on a sound, the breath, object, or attention itself to increase awareness of the present moment. Its purpose is to reduce stress, promote relaxation, or increase spiritual growth.
• Mind–brain relationship is the interaction of the mind (consciousness) and brain (nerve cells) summed up in the saying “minds are what brains do.”
• Mindfulness is the moment-by-moment awareness of one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, and environment without evaluating or judging them.
• Neuroplasticity is the brain’s capacity to restructure itself after training or practice allowing personal growth and development to occur.
• Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, particularly the functioning of the brain.


Contemplative neuroscience is the scientific study of how the brain and nervous system are affected by contemplative practices. Over the past three decades, researchers have discovered how deeply the human brain is influenced by both human experience and the environment. This influence begins early in


life and extends throughout the lifespan. This new understanding of the brain’s capacity to change and develop, called neuroplasticity, provides insight into personal growth transformation (development) that once seemed impossible. This increasing awareness of the brain’s plasticity means that the goal of decreasing or eliminating mental and nervous illness may be possible. It also means that mental and emotional health can be greatly increased. Contemplative neuroscience is one method for accomplishing these goals.



Thich Nhat Hanh (1926–), a Zen Buddhist monk and teacher, conducted a retreat on mindfulness in the United States. One of the attendees was the American psychologist Jon Kabat-Zinn (1944–). In 1979, Kabat-Zinn adapted Hanh’s teachings on mindfulness into his eight-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course. This course and its emphasis on mindfulness has since spread throughout North America and to other western countries. At about the same time, the American psychologists Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson were researching and writing about neuroscience and emotions. In the 1980s, Davidson began a collaboration with the Dalai Lama, Buddhist monk and spiritual leader. As a result, Davidson became increasing involved in practicing and researching meditation. Throughout the next decade of research, he, and several other researchers, extensively studied mindfulness and meditation. Since the early 2000s the terms “contemplative science” and “contemplative neuroscience” emerged, reflecting basic research and applications in clinical and educational settings.
   The research on neuroplasticity shows that specific kinds of mental training can influence how the brain functions. More specifically, it shows how emotional and mental well-being can be cultivated through various disciplines, including contemplative practices such as meditation and mindfulness. An individual’s emotional set-points can be shifted toward higher levels of well-being. In contrast, conventional psychiatry focuses treatment on reducing symptoms





and discomfort with medications, without necessarily addressing the deeper causal issues behind the symptoms and distress. While medication may have a role in treatment of symptoms, it is incapable of teaching the brain new and healthy neurological habits. Contemplative training and meditation, however, can change such habits. Unlike conventional psychiatry, contemplative neuroscience assumes that brain and mind interactions are bidirectional. That means that mind can influence and change the brain, just as the brain can influence and change the mind.
   A general goal of contemplative neuroscience is to empower individuals to become the masters of their own minds so they can experience more wholeness, more joy, and more peace. More specifically, loving kindness and compassion can be cultivated and hard-wired (made permanent) in the brain. In short, contemplative neuroscience offers a scientific worldview capable of radically changing what individuals believe is possible for their lives and the lives of future generations.


Conversion disorder is a mental health condition characterized by paralysis, seizures, or other neurologic


symptoms that cannot be explained by medical evaluation. It is also known as functional neurological symptom disorder and hysteria.

• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.
• Dissociation is a detachment from reality. Daydreaming is a non-pathological form of dissociation, while depersonalization (a sense that the self is unreal) is a pathological form of dissociation.
• Dissociative disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a disturbance of self, memory, awareness, or consciousness which cause disrupted life functioning.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Malingering is the practice of intentionally exaggerating or faking physical or psychological symptoms for personal gain. It is also referred to as fictitious illness.
• Mindfulness practices are intentional activities that foster living in the present moment and an awareness that is nonjudgmental and accepting.
• Somatic symptom and related disorders are a group of DSM-5 mental disorders characterized by prominent somatic symptoms and significant distress and impairment. They include somatic symptom disorder, factitious disorder, and conversion disorder. Previously they were known as somatoform disorders.
• Somatoform disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by physical symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition. DSM-5 calls them somatic symptom and related disorders.





• Stress management is a set of psychological techniques for increasing the capacity to better cope with psychological stress. It usually includes relaxation methods.


Conversion disorder is a dissociative disorder that was named to describe a health concern that begins as a psychological stressor or trauma but then “converts” to physical symptoms. Such symptoms appear suddenly and affect individuals’ basic senses and movement such as their ability to see, hear, swallow, or walk. While individuals may describe their symptoms in detail, they often show little concern or indifference about symptoms. Historically, this disorder has been referred to as La Belle Indifference (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This indifference can be a useful clue in distinguishing conversion disorder from the medical condition it may mimic. Symptoms can be severe at first. Fortunately for many individuals with this disorder, symptoms tend to improve within a short time.
   Conversion disorder is more often diagnosed in women than men. Often these individuals are not psychologically minded (insightful) and they are likely to have an early history of abuse, particularly sexual abuse. The tendency toward dissociation is commonly seen with these individuals. This means they deal with stressors by removing themselves psychologically from these situations as a way of safeguarding themselves. In this way, they pay little or no attention to certain events and so they are less likely to remember or be concerned about them.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they experience symptoms of voluntary motor function or of sensory function such as weakness or paralysis of a limb or reduced ability to see or hear. What makes these symptoms problematic is that clinical findings cannot explain why these symptoms are occurring, or if there is a neurological disorder present, the symptoms cannot be accounted for by such illness. However, these symptoms contribute to significant disruption in work, relationships, or family life. The


symptoms cannot be explained by another medical or mental condition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is not well understood, but it appears that it is triggered by a stressful event, a relational conflict, or another mental disorder, such as depression. Individual personality dynamics appear to be involved, particularly feeling avoidance. A careful development history often reveals a pattern of feeling avoidance and confusion of physical sensations with feelings. As children, these individuals seldom experienced empathy or validation of their wishes, thoughts, and feelings. Instead they learned to value logic over feelings. They learned to discount not only their feelings but their bodily sensations as well. As they got older, they may have appeared to others to be healthy on the outside when in fact they were not. For instance, measures of heart rhythms or blood pressure could be clearly abnormal while they appear calm on the outside. In short, because their wishes, thoughts, and feelings were often discouraged or punished, they stopped paying attention to them. These experiences also contribute to a lack of psychological mindedness (insight), which is commonly seen in conversion disorders.


For most individuals, symptoms of this disorder resolve (get better) without treatment, often,the reassurance of a health professional that there is no serious medical condition underlying the conversion symptoms. For others, counseling or psychotherapy can be helpful in treating symptoms and preventing their reoccurrence. However, psychotherapy may be necessary if anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues are present. Allowing such individuals to talk about the stressor that triggers their symptoms in a safe environment can be very therapeutic. Cognitive behavior therapy can be particularly helpful in recognizing and distinguishing feelings from somatic (bodily) sensations. Teaching stress management techniques and mindfulness practices can further increase awareness and reduce stress and anxiety.


Coping is a psychological concept and is defined as the internal mental efforts and the external behavioral efforts a person makes in order to manage and respond to difficult, demanding, and stressful events.

Stress is a part of the human experience and how people cope with stress can influence their lives in significant ways. Stress is defined as the relationship between a person and the environment that is judged by the person as difficult or exceeding his or her ability to experience physical, social, emotional, or psychological well-being.
   Richard Lazarus, one of the top 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, was instrumental in developing a theory of stress and coping. Lazarus found that when coping was effective, stress is controlled. When coping is ineffective, stress increases leading to physical and/or emotional difficulties and impaired social functioning. Lazarus used the phrase “cognitive appraisal” to refer to how a person thinks about and evaluates stressful events. There are two cognitive appraisals that take place in a person’s mind when faced with stressful events: primary


and secondary. Primary appraisals evaluate the impact of an event. Secondary appraisals evaluate what can be done to manage and cope with, or respond to, the event. Each of these appraisals interacts with each other to determine how much stress is experienced. For instance, imagine that there is a major paper due in class on Monday. This paper will have a significant impact on the grade for the course. Also imagine that there is an all-day music festival on Saturday and everyone will be there. How a student spends Saturday, that is his or her behavior, will be determined by his or her primary cognitive appraisal of the importance of the grade (what is at stake) and his or her secondary cognitive appraisal of what he or she needs to do to receive a good grade. One student has already written a complete and thorough draft and only needs to proofread the paper before turning it in. This student attends the festival with little or no stress about the assignment. The student’s primary appraisal is that attending the music festival will have no impact on his or her grade. The student’s secondary appraisal of what he or she needs to do to receive a good grade (a final proofread that is easily accomplished on Sunday) allows him or her to attend the festival. Another student, however, has put off the assignment and has written very little. The student’s primary appraisal is that he or she will fail the class if he or she does not receive a good grade on the assignment. The student is very stressed, that is, the student is anxious and worried about the final grade. The student’s secondary appraisal is that if he or she attends the festival, he or she will not have the time to produce a good paper. Another secondary cognitive appraisal is that there will be other music festivals to attend but only one chance to do well on the paper. The student copes with the stress of the assignment by choosing to stay home and work hard on the paper (his or her behavior), which decreases stress (anxiety).




A corrective emotional experience is a novel, positive reexperiencing of a past negative emotional event or pattern.


• Psychodynamic theory is a broad category of psychological theories that view thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as the result of unconscious process.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Therapeutic alliance is the moment-to-moment, interactive relationship between an individual and a therapist that should include mutual trust, respect, and collaboration. It is also called a therapeutic relationship.


Corrective emotional experience is a treatment strategy by which an individual experiences a previously negative pattern of thinking, acting, or relating in an unexpected new and healthier way. This change occurs because the individual is better able to tolerate the past negative experience under more favorable circumstances. Such a positive reexperience can contribute significantly to positive outcomes in psychotherapy.


Typically, the event or pattern that is reexperienced is related to the presenting issue or focus of psychotherapy and is facilitated by the therapist. The corrective experience helps the individual to reshape his or her understanding of the “self” (who the individual thinks he or she is) in relationship to others. That is to say that the individual is able to redefine who he or she is by experiencing an interaction with another, in this case a therapist, differently than ever before. It is different from insight, whereby an individual gains a purely intellectual understanding of an issue. Insight alone is not necessarily sufficient for significant growth and healing. This experience may occur during a therapy session, or it can occur outside of therapy as a result of the interactions that took place within the session.
   There are two different interpretations of this general term. In the past, this term was most closely associated with psychodynamic theories. Consequently, the original interpretation refers to positive consequences that result from the difference between how a therapist reacts to the individual and how the individual expected the therapist to react. This discrepancy causes the individual to have a new and different interpretation of a relationship with another, thereby causing a corrective emotional experience. Today, the broader term “corrective experience” is used to reflect other perspectives besides psychodynamic theory. This more contemporary interpretation refers to any aspect of the interaction between the individual and therapist that results in the individual having a new and unexpected corrective experience.
   There are four types of corrective experiences: emotional, relational, cognitive, and behavioral. Each type represents a differing mechanism of initiating the corrective experience. But all involve an emotional response as the individual learns new ways of responding or experiencing as compared to their previous patterns. An emotional type represents the original understanding of corrective emotional experience whereby the individual experiences a new and different emotional reaction to an unsettled past event. A more specific type is the relational, whereby the individual has a transformational experience as consequence of a new way of interacting with a therapist or another. The cognitive type represents an experience of a new mental process (way of thinking) about a past event. Lastly,





the behavioral type represents a new way of acting in response to something or someone.
   For a corrective experience to occur, the individual must be engaged in the interaction and must be willing to take risks. It follows that the individual must feel as if the therapeutic environment is safe enough to be sufficiently vulnerable. It is therefore unlikely, if not impossible, that an individual will be able to feel and act in such a way if there is not sufficient trust, respect, and collaboration between the therapist and the individual; this is referred to as the therapeutic alliance or relationship. It is the relationship, not a specific intervention (therapeutic technique), which is of primary importance in creating the opportunity for the corrective experience.




Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs is the accrediting agency for counseling profession. It is also known as CACREP.


CACREP is a counseling-specific accrediting organization that is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. CACREP was created in 1981 by the American Personnel and Guidance Association, which was the predecessor of the American Counseling Association. CACREP was created for the purpose of being the accrediting body for the counseling profession.


   More than 30 years ago, leaders in the field of counseling donated their time, expertise, and vision to create an accrediting body that would hold the profession to a higher standard of training and education of graduate students. This includes students at both master’s and doctoral levels, although doctoral accreditation came a few years later, but still dates back more than 25 years. It was hoped that by creating these standards of education and training it would, in turn, increase the level of competency of graduating professional counselors entering the field.
   Within the U.S. higher education system, accreditation can be achieved in two distinct ways. One is through the university or college and the other is through a specific education program within the university or college. CACREP offers the latter, a specialized accreditation that looks solely at the preparation of graduate students within the counseling profession. However, CACREP has a fairly wide scope of accreditation, including program areas of addiction counseling; career counseling; clinical mental health counseling; marriage, couple, and family counseling; school counseling; student affairs and college counseling; and counselor education and supervision.
   The accreditation process can take several years to apply (or reapply) and involves a team of CACREP counselor educators visiting the university to review its programs and ensure that it meets eight core areas of national standards in counseling, including the helping relationship, human growth and development, appraisal, research, professional orientation, social and cultural foundations, and group counseling.


The most important factor in a counseling program is the proper preparation of students to enter the field as competent professionals who can practice independently. To achieve this, proper gatekeeping policies and procedures must be in place, as well as standards of education and training, since inadequate training can lead to psychological harm to clients, mistrust of the profession, or even ethical misconduct on behalf of the counselor. This is where CACREP standards come in. The current standards being used were updated in





2009. New revisions are being made to these standards, with an update expected in 2016.
   According to several studies, the impact of accreditation can be seen in the fact that counselors who receive their training at CACREP-accredited institutions have significantly fewer ethics violations compared to non-CACREP-accredited program graduates. In addition, CACREP program graduates have been found to score higher on their licensure exams, suggesting that they are more knowledgeable in ethics and professional conduct than their non-CACREP-accredited counterparts. Notably, it has also been suggested that CACREP-accredited programs attract and retain higher-caliber students, which could also explain their compliance with ethical codes, higher scores on licensure exams, and holding to higher professional standards. This, in turn, leads to an overall higher level of competency for graduates of CACREP-accredited programs.





Counseling and counseling psychology are mental health professions that prevent and treat mental conditions, as well as advocate for optimal human development.


• Behavioral psychology is a form of psychology whose aim is to study behavioral adaptation to an environment and its stimuli.
• Biopsychosocial model is a way of conceptualizing (thinking about) health and illness in terms of biological, psychological, and social factors rather than purely in biological terms. It is also referred to as the biopsychosocial perspective.
• Clinical health psychology is the branch of psychology informed by the biopsychosocial model of health and emphasizes behavioral medicine interventions in working with psychological problems and related disability.
• Clinical psychology is the branch of psychology that emphasizes the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that addresses maladaptive thought distortions that lead to unwanted emotional and behavioral symptoms.





• Cognitive psychology is a form of psychology whose aim is to study thought and distorted patterns of thinking.
• Evidence-based treatments are therapeutic interventions (techniques) that scientific research demonstrates to be effective in facilitating therapeutic change. It is also known as empirically supported treatments.
• Humanistic psychology is an experiential form of psychology developed out of the work of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, which emphasizes a client’s capacity for self-actualization and unique positive personal growth.
• Psychiatry is the branch of medicine and form of psychology that emphasizes the medical management of psychological problems and related disability.
• Psychoanalytic psychology is the form of psychology largely developed by the work of Sigmund Freud, which emphasizes the conflicts and compromises between the unconscious and conscious mind.
• Psychopathology is a maladaptive experience of suffering or aspect of a psychological condition incorporating cause, development, structure, and consequences.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.



Counseling and counseling psychology are two closely related fields within the mental health profession. There are significant similarities and differences between counseling and counseling psychology. The major similarity between counselors and counseling psychologists is that they both primarily practice psychotherapy. The focus of their practice is to treat as well as to prevent psychopathology and related disability. They


also help clients resolve hindrances to optimal growth and development. Counselors and counseling psychologists utilize evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions to reduce the suffering or consequences associated with psychopathology and related disability. Highly effective counselors and counseling psychologists, however, do more than reduce symptoms. For example, they are more likely to focus on solutions rather than on symptom and psychopathology. They may also assist clients in increasing their level of functioning and psychological well-being. In counseling and counseling psychology therapy sessions, the present moment almost always includes an interpersonal interaction between a trained therapist and client(s). The therapeutic relationship is the primary method for remediating the consequences of a client’s mental disorder, problem, or complaint.
   Counseling and counseling psychology, like clinical psychology and clinical health psychology, are informed by the biopsychosocial perspective of health and illness. Clinical health psychology emphasizes behavioral medicine in working with psychological problems and related disability. Counseling and counseling psychology, in contrast, emphasize psychotherapy or therapeutic counseling. Most counselors and counseling psychologists are integrative and value a team-based approach to mental health. They will refer clients to other mental health specialists, such as psychiatrists, for adjunctive (supportive/secondary) treatment. This holistic approach to mental health enhances the ability to predict, assess, diagnose, and alleviate psychological problems and related dysfunction.
   Counseling and counseling psychology share three major traditional theoretical perspectives. These are the psychoanalytic, cognitive behavioral, and humanistic traditions. More recently, systems theory has been incorporated into many aspects of counseling. Theoretical orientations such as these, in addition to client preference, guide psychotherapeutic intervention. Counseling and counseling psychology is a system of subspecialties more than it is a single specialty within the mental health profession. The system of subspecialties continues to be developed and refined as new information is acquired via science and practice. This leads to increasing diversity in ways of conceptualizing




The terms “counselor,” “psychotherapist,” and “therapist” are still used interchangeably. One of the major distinctions between counseling and counseling psychology is the educational requirements necessary to become a counselor versus a counseling psychologist. The term “psychologist” in counseling psychologist has been regulated by law and is limited to use by those who have undergone specialized training. Counseling psychologists have earned a doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree or doctor of psychology (PsyD) degree in psychology and have been licensed in the state(s) in which they intend on practicing. On the other hand, counselors at least earn a master’s degree in counseling and have been certified nationally or licensed by the state(s) in which they intend on practicing. These educational requirements are governed by two major professional affiliations. While highly favorable, a degree from an accredited educational program is not required for certification or licensure. The most highly acclaimed educational programs in counseling psychology are accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). The APA was established in 1892. In 1945, APA established Division 17, the Division of Personnel and Guidance Psychologists. It was renamed the Division of Counseling Psychology in 1951. Division 17 of the APA is not as influential as it once was. For example, counseling psychologists were first utilized to give vocational guidance and advice. Today, vocational guidance is often given by non-licensed career advisors and career coaches, although some counselors and counseling psychologists still practice career counseling. When developing a career in counseling, the most prestigious counseling degrees are governed by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). CACREP was established in 1981. The creation of CACREP occurred only eight years after the PsyD degree was accepted by the APA. The PsyD practitioner-scholar model, otherwise known as the Vail Model, was a departure from the PhD scientist-practitioner model, otherwise


known as the Boulder Model. As counseling training programs increasingly deviated from an emphasis on research, a new field of Counselor Education was born. CACREP is gaining much legislative influence and significantly contributing to the development of the counseling profession. This trend may continue because counselors are more cost effective than counseling psychologists. Historically, however, counseling and counseling psychology have shared many similarities. The word “counselor” comes from the Latin word consulere, which means to consult, advise, or deliberate. Counselors and counseling psychologists tend to focus on treating clients who are from a “normal” population. In other words, counselors and counseling psychologists make themselves available to work with clients who are without serious or chronic mental illnesses. Counselors and counseling psychologists tend to treat problems of living and concerns related to individual development across the lifespan, including most mental disorders. Chronic and debilitating mental disorders and related disabilities are better treated by clinical psychologists, neuropsychologists, and the medical community.

Counterdependent personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by denial of dependency on others and an unwillingness to ask for help when in need.




• Avoidant personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a pattern of social withdrawal, feelings of inadequacy, and oversensitivity to negative evaluation.
• Codependent is an emotional and behavioral condition that affects an individual’s ability to have a healthy relationship because he or she often forms or maintains relationships that are one-sided, emotionally destructive, and often abusive.
• Depression is an emotional state characterized by feelings of sadness, guilt, or reduced ability to enjoy life. It is recognized as a mental disorder when it becomes significantly distressing and disrupts daily life.
• DSM stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a pattern of grandiosity, lack of empathy, and need to be admired by others.
• Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.
• PDM stands for the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual and is a diagnostic framework that characterizes individuals in terms of their psychodynamics (forces that determine personality).

Counterdependent personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by difficulty being close


to others, a strong need to be right all of the time, self-centeredness, resistance in asking for help, and expectations of perfection in self and others. Individuals with this disorder have extreme discomfort when appearing weak or vulnerable and have difficulty relaxing. They are often addicted to several activities (e.g., constantly engaged in work or exercise). They tend to act strong while pushing others away, and exhibit extreme grandiose behaviors, which is a feature of narcissistic personality disorder. They often avoid contact with others (e.g., avoidant personality disorder), particularly out of fear of being crowded, and this can lead to emotional isolation and depression. The counterdependent male may take pride in himself not needing warmth, affection, or support in any relationship. He takes pleasure in being tough and independent. The counterdependent female may take on the attributes of a false self or male persona (image). The independent behavior of the counterdependent individual can act as a powerful lure for a codependent. An individual who is codependent exhibits symptoms of having low self-esteem and poor boundaries (limits), and is a people pleaser and caretaker. As a couple, codependent and counterdependent individuals can often switch roles.
In 1993, Robert Bornstein (1948–) described
that there is a continuum from maladaptive dependency (submissiveness) through healthy interdepen-dency (connectedness) to inflexible independence (unconnected detachment). Some individuals at the inflexibility end of the spectrum have powerful dependent longings that they keep out of awareness by denial and reaction formation. Essentially, this develops into having a personality disorder concealed by pseudo-independence. They define themselves in relationships as the individual whom others depend on and take pleasure for being able to take care of themselves. Individuals with this disorder may look skeptically at expressions of need and may regard evidence of emotional vulnerability in themselves or others with contempt. Often, these individuals have some secret of dependency (e.g., addiction to a substance, a partner, an ideology). Some individuals have a tendency toward illness or injury that gives them a justifiable reason to be cared for by others.
According	to	the	Psychodynamic	Diagnostic Manual, the psychopathic personality disorder is





diagnosable by the following criteria. Individuals are possibly more aggressive than openly dependent individuals. They are preoccupied with demonstrating a lack of dependence (e.g., shameful dependence). Individuals exhibit contempt for others and are in denial of weaker emotions, such as sadness, fear, longing, and envy. Their basic belief is that they do not need anyone. Their view of others is that everyone needs and depends on them and requires them in their lives in order to be strong and succeed. Furthermore, these individuals defend themselves through denial (PDM Task Force, 2006).


Treatment for individuals with this disorder tends to be challenging. Counterdependent individuals rarely seek psychotherapy in order to avoid the possibility of regression. By eluding psychotherapy, an individual with this disorder can avoid discussing feelings as well as attempting to control the therapist in order to maintain his or her sense of independence. However, if an individual has a partner who is likely feeling a lack of true intimacy, the partner may be forced or given an ultimatum in participating in psychotherapy. While in treatment, individuals with this disorder need assistance in accepting their dependent desires as a natural part of being human before they can develop a healthy balance between separateness and connectedness. Progress in therapy can occur only when the individual can reflect on and mourn his or her early unmet dependency needs and become less defensive (PDM Task Force, 2006).


Counterphobic personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by actively seeking out that which is feared.


• Anxiety is a negative emotional state characterized by feelings of nervousness, worry, and apprehension about imagined danger.
• Depression is an emotional state characterized by feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, guilt, or reduced ability to enjoy life.
• DSM stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental disorder characterized by unwanted and repeated thoughts and feelings (obsessions), or behaviors that one feels driven to perform (compulsions). It is commonly referred to as OCD.
• Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behavior, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.
• PDM stands for the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual and is a diagnostic framework that characterizes individuals in terms of their psychodynamics.





• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also referred to as therapeutic counseling.


Counterphobic personality disorder is an uncommon personality disorder. It is characterized by actively seeking out fearful objects and situations. Those with this disorder are attracted to dangerous situations, thrive on taking risks, and have a reputation for intimidating others when exposed to immediate danger. They tend to put themselves in dangerous situations that are so irresistible and forceful that they cannot resist dangerous opportunities to reveal their fearlessness. They may also exhibit magical thinking. For example, they may believe that thinking or wishing for something can cause it to occur. Remarkably, individuals with this disorder have great confidence that they are safe no matter what danger they encounter.
   Some children and adolescents appear to have a high threshold for stimulation and the need to deny any fear. Therapists describe these individuals as those who cannot swim yet will jump into the deep end of a swimming pool. Adolescents with this disorder often engage in reckless driving, take drugs on occasion, and engage in high-risk sexual behavior. Younger children with this disorder are often faced with a sense of powerlessness or fear of being lifeless. On the more adaptive (functional) end of the spectrum, children and adolescents become involved in risky activities but in a more controlled way. At the maladaptive (dysfunctional) end of the spectrum, children and adolescents with this disorder tease with the idea of potentially suicidal behavior (PDM Task Force, 2006).
   According to the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual, counterphobic personality disorder is diagnosable by the following criteria. Individuals are preoccupied with safety and danger. Their contributing maturational patterns are unknown. Their main affects or feelings are contempt for others and denial of fear. They view themselves as fearless and able to face anything without fear. They tend to view others as easily frightened and that others admire their courage. 


those with this disorder defend themselves through denial, through projection (e.g., making a prediction on known evidence or observations), and by means of defensiveness (PDM Task Force, 2006).

Treatment for individuals with this disorder tends to be challenging. Individuals with counterphobic personality disorder rarely seek psychotherapy. However, they may participate in psychotherapy to address symptomatic problems such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Treatment is also difficult because of their need to deny ordinary anxieties and their tendency to present themselves with a sense of boldness that makes talking with a therapist about any feelings difficult. Therapists may experience anxiety when these individuals talk about their risk-taking behaviors and irritation when they describe their sense of having unlimited power (PDM Task Force, 2006).

Couples therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on strengthening the relationship bond and resolving conflicts between couples of all types.




• Atheoretical refers to untested treatments that are not based on theory.
• Cohabitation is to live together with someone in a marriage, or marriage like, sexual relationship.
• Conjoint therapy takes place when both relationship partners are present in a therapy session.
• Couples refer to two people in an established married or unmarried partnership and may include, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and heterosexual couples.
• Infidelity is the act of having a romantic or sexual relationship with someone other than a wife, husband, or committed partner; it is also referred to as cheating, adultery, or having an affair.
• In-laws are the people you become related to through marriage, that is, the mother of a wife is referred to as the husband’s mother-in-law.
• LGBT is an abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender couples.
• Marriage and family therapist is a protected professional title that designates an individual as meeting the educational standards set forth by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education.
• Marriage counseling is another term for couples counseling.
• Psychotherapy is a general term referring to a variety of talking treatments aimed at strengthening mental health, emotional, or relational problems.
• Theory refers to a body of knowledge, or set of principles, that explains the phenomenon in question.


Couples therapy (CT) is a form of psychotherapy provided to all types of couples, including lesbian, gay,


bisexual, transgender, and heterosexual couples. Historically referred to as “marital” or “marriage” counseling, the term “couples therapy” is increasingly becoming the preferred term. The use of the term “couples” recognizes that many couples cohabitate together while remaining unmarried.
   The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) is the professional association, which represents over 25,000 marriage and family therapists. The AAMFT also serves as the accrediting organization for graduate training education in marriage and family counseling. Licensure as a marriage and family therapist is regulated by individual states.
   Trained therapists provide CT, with most states requiring a graduate mental health degree and state license in order to provide CT. Therapist includes clinical psychologist, mental health counselors, clinical social workers, marriage and family therapist, and pastoral counselors. Couples counseling aims to assist couples strengthen their bond, resolve conflicts, and improve their relationship. CT is usually short term consisting of 12 to 20 sessions. There are a variety of therapeutic approaches and techniques to CT. Couples seek counseling for a variety of reasons, including relationship distress, improve relationship satisfaction, strengthen communication and problem-solving skills, working through issues related to infidelity, sexual difficulties and compatibilities, financial stresses, conflicts, parenting, and in-law issues.
   Four phases in the development of CT have been identified, with each phase significantly influencing the expansion of methods and understanding of couples. Phase one (1930 to 1963), the “Atheoretical Marriage Counseling Formation” phase, was the pioneering phase of modern-day CT. Counseling was not based on any theories or scientific understanding of couples. Interventions consisted mostly of advice giving, extoling the virtues of family life, and educating couples on their legal and social obligations.
   Phase two (1931–1966), the “Psychoanalytic Experimentation” phase, began to question the effectiveness of a traditional psychoanalytic approach in which partners were seen individually with the hope that as they each progressed through psychoanalysis, their stress would decrease and the relationship would benefit. Psychoanalysis was grounded in the belief that





psychological and social dysfunctions were due solely to problems within the individual. Couples who were seen individually rarely, if ever, described a shared event, such as a conflict, in the same way. At the time no theories existed that addressed how to understand multiple perspectives and help multiple people at the same time in a therapy session. This led to conjoint marital therapy in which two individuals are seen at the same time. Conjoint therapy was revolutionary from a psychoanalytic perspective. Phase two was a time of tremendous growth and theoretical development in understanding couples and how to help them. In 1942, the American Association of Marriage Counselors was formed and later renamed as the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy.
   Phase three (1963–1985) is the “Family Therapy Incorporation” stage. Theorists were no longer limited to a psychoanalytic perspective and began to focus on family dynamics. During this time, family therapy became the predominate focus of developing psychotherapies and marital counseling was largely absorbed into the family therapy movement. There was a tremendous increase in the development of theories during this time that focused on understanding the complex interactions and behaviors of families. The years 1975 to 1985 are considered the golden age of family therapy and several groundbreaking theories were developed. Four highly influential clinical family theorists include Don Jackson (Family Rules: Marital Quid Pro Quo), Virginia Satir (Family Therapy: Concepts and Methods), Murray Bowen (Family Systems Theory and Practice), and Jay Haley (Strategic Family Therapy). These, and many other theorists, incorporated ideas into how couples behaved in the family, and toward each other, and what impact the marital relationship had on healthy family functioning.
Phase four (1986–present) is the “Refinement,
Extension, Diversification, and Integration” phase. Emerging out of the family therapy movement, CT reasserted its existence in the mid-1980s. Continuing to the present CT theory, research and the development of practical psychotherapies to helping couples have become increasingly refined and integrated with other forms of psychotherapy. For instance, emotion focused couple therapy and behavioral couple therapy are well-established forms of CT first developed in the


1980s and further refined through substantial research support. CT has also been integrated with psychotherapies originally developed as individual therapies such as solution focused therapy.
   Couples therapy, in all its forms, has been shown to be effective. Research has consistently established that couples who receive any form of CT are better off after treatment than couples who received no treatment. Although there are numerous types of CT, few studies have examined which models are more effective when compared against each other.

Covert sensitization is a therapeutic technique in which an undesirable behavior is associated with an unpleasant image in order to try to control or eliminate the undesirable behavior.


Covert sensitization is used in behavior and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). By using this technique, the therapist helps the client identify the problem and then uses negative images or experiences to prevent it from





happening in the future. The hallmark of covert sensitization is that it happens in the imagination, which makes it covert. Examples of such techniques would be things like vomiting due to overeating or excessive consumption of alcohol in order to reduce addictive behaviors. During treatment, the client is encouraged to imagine the undesirable behavior and then associate it with an unpleasant or disgusting consequence.
   The aim in covert sensitization is for the client to move away from his or her present thoughts and behaviors. For example, a client believes what he or she is doing is wrong or undesirable. Then the goal is for the client to shift his or her beliefs about the experience through feeling different unpleasant physical effects. A client who wants to quit smoking may be encouraged to imagine puffing on a cigarette and then associate it with a picture of black and decaying lung tissue. The aversive images are only powerful when they are based on things that the client finds truly negative. This is a form of imaged aversion therapy, and it is based on the idea that behavior is learned and can therefore be changed.

In the 1960s psychologist Joseph Cautela was the first to outline a procedure for covert sensitization. He and his colleague Albert Kearney later published The Covert Conditioning Handbook in 1986. This handbook discussed the technique based on research investigations and case studies.
   Because it does not require drugs and is relatively simple to implement, covert sensitization has been applied over the years. The technique has been used with many problematic and undesirable behaviors. Among them are alcoholism, smoking, gambling, obesity, and various sexual dysfunctions. Many programs using covert sensitization have had positive clinical results.
   Prior to 1974, homosexuality was still identified as a mental illness. During that time covert sensitization was one of the approaches used to try to change or convert sexual orientation. Even though the majority of mental health professionals have changed their stance on this, there are still sexual reorientation or reparation programs that target the homosexual population. Covert sensitization is still used by fundamentalist religious groups, for example, who adhere to the belief


that nonheterosexual orientation is a mental illness and continue to use this as a therapeutic technique.

Covert sensitization continues to be applied both in therapy and in other fields. This includes people who experience a wide variety of psychosocial problems, from smoking cessation to sexual impulse control, even to drug addiction. One of its appeals is that it avoids the risks involved in drug and pharmacological interventions by using visualization and imagery. Covert sensitization has been used in the treatment of alcoholism, but the results remain controversial.
   One critique of covert sensitization is that it does not concern itself with the roots of undesirable behaviors. Many believe that because of this, underlying psychological motivation can persist and therefore real change does not occur. The concern then is that problem thoughts and behaviors can resurface leading to a renewal of problems when and if the aversive imagery loses its power.


“Crisis housing” refers to programs that provide short-term housing or residential assistance to people suffering from emergencies or serious mental health issues.





• Crisis is an event, or series of events, in a person’s life marked by danger, instability, and chaos that negatively impacts his or her life.

Within the mental health community, crisis housing is a temporary residence or institution for the treatment of people suffering from a recent crisis. Although sometimes referred to as crisis group homes, they differ from therapeutic group homes in their intent, focus, and duration of stay. In many communities, crisis housing has been therapeutically successful. It has also been found to be a cost-effective alternative to expensive psychiatric inpatient hospitalization. The provision of crisis housing has led to a reduction in the number of people who need to be admitted to more traditional clinical settings.


Crisis housing began as a service to help people who were not able to find safe or healthy shelter. Based on emergency situations, crisis housing applies to victims of man-made and natural disasters. But crisis housing has also been important as a response to social, familial, and personal problems for some. It can provide a safe environment for those who are threatened by other people, like abusers, or by their own internal psychological problems, like psychosis.
   Beginning in the 1980s, many local communities and governments began to provide crisis housing and case management services as an alternative to psychiatric hospitalization. Crisis housing has taken many forms, from conversion of hotels to refitted private homes. Although not without issues, crisis housing has proved effective in providing space and opportunity for treatment.
   One example of a program that uses crisis housing is the Assertive Community Treatment program. This serves as an intervention program that treats people with serious mental illness in a comprehensive, multidisciplinary setting outside of a clinical or hospital setting. The model originated in the late 1970s with


the Program of Assertive Community Treatment in Madison, Wisconsin. It grew out of the need to find community-based services as deinstitutionalization, or removal from clinical hospital settings, became the norm. Assertive Community Treatment is often referred to as a hospital without walls.


Studies have shown that patients who have the opportunity to live in crisis housing tend to engage in treatment more effectively and have better outcomes. Crisis housing has been publicly supported in many states for patients with mental health issues. This is because it reduces the cost of treatment by avoiding expensive hospital or inpatient programs. Crisis housing can provide clients with the opportunity for a comprehensive approach to treatment.





Crisis intervention is a fast assessment and response to help people involved in a crisis situation cope and move toward physical and emotional resolution.

Definition
• Crisis is an event, or series of events, in a person’s life marked by danger, instability, and chaos that negatively impacts his or her life.


Crisis intervention usually occurs when an individual’s or group of people’s ability to cope has been exhausted or destroyed. Generally, crises usually require outside support where physical, psychological, and social resources are needed to help people overcome intolerable situations. The crisis could be an individual trauma, like suicide, or a natural disaster, like a tornado, or a man-made disaster, such as terrorism. An example of a crisis is the Japanese tsunami of 2011. This natural event caused personal, civic, and regional crises that affected the people directly and the country itself could not address alone. They needed help from others to restore calm and order and even provide both basic and long-term social needs for those in the disaster or crisis zone.
   The simplest approach to crisis intervention is the so-called ABC method. A is establishing and maintaining contact, B is identifying the problem clearly, and C is developing coping mechanisms. For health-care professionals the more common situations that demand crisis intervention are based around individual and family issues, horrific events such as death, sexual assault, or other violent crimes. These events shake people so deeply that they are robbed of their usual ability to assess and respond on their own. In this situation crisis intervention is often called crisis counseling and is to be conducted only by those specifically trained to provide this kind of treatment.

There are individual organizations, such as the Red Cross, that have long helped people in disaster situations. The history of crisis intervention as a distinct concept dates back to the 1942 Boston Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire. The fire killed almost 500 people and plunged the community into a traumatic state. Eric Lindemann and Gerald Caplan, known as the fathers of crisis intervention, formed modern crisis intervention based on the response to that experience.
   In 1963 federal law mandated the creation of community mental health centers to assist people in crisis. But the early success of these efforts was limited. It was in the late 1970s that the Federal Emergency


Management Agency (FEMA) was established by the government. FEMA was created to plan, coordinate, and deliver emergency assistance in cases of widespread social need.
   While there are different approaches to crisis intervention, the ACT process created by Albert Roberts, PhD, has been widely used. It has been applied to significant crisis events such as the response to the 9/11 terror attacks. Roberts recommends that those professionals who intervene should take specific steps when intervening to help with a crisis. The first step is to assess the deadly danger or lethality of the situation and the mental state of those involved. The next step is to establish rapport with and get the attention of those impacted by the crisis in order to connect with them. After this it is important to identify the major issues involved and spend time processing and dealing with the feelings of those affected. Next, professionals should apply some immediate emotional coping mechanisms and temporary or partial responses to the event. Once these short-term solutions are put in place, the next step is to develop a long-term action plan, including decisions about when the intervention should end and what will be done to follow up.
Crisis or critical incident debriefing is widely implemented immediately after a disaster. It was used in the crisis event of the mass shooting at a school in Columbine, Colorado, in 1999. Although helpful in the short-term, crisis intervention has been critiqued for being insufficient for long-term problems. This is especially true for those who have symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, which may show up only months after a traumatic event occurs.


As the world continues to change politically, socially, and environmentally, crises will continue to occur. There is no doubt that crisis intervention skills will continue to be needed on many levels. Although key elements of response by professionals include critical incident debriefing and stabilization, longer-term interventions may also be needed to service those more severely or even chronically affected.
   The success of crisis intervention efforts depends on three things. It is important that the intervention





be provided in a timely, effective, and well-trained fashion. This should involve not only mental health professionals but police, hot-line operators, clergy, government workers, and more. Crisis prevention and intervention is an important focus for those professionals dealing with people engaging in risky behavior. Often in the workplace, the skills of professionals in human resources are only brought to bear after a traumatic event has occurred.



“Cults” refer to religious and social fringe groups regarded by the majority culture as engaging in sinister, strange, exploitive, and psychologically harmful beliefs and practices.


The term “cults” has been widely used in popular culture in describing destructive fringe religious and social groups. Religious researchers prefer to use the phrase “new religious movement” (NRM), recognizing that not all NRMs are harmful to their followers. Here “cult” will be used to refer to intense groups, frequently religious but not rooted in a mainstream religion, formed around a controlling and manipulative charismatic leader, which demand unwavering devotion, and pose a physical, psychological, or exploitive danger to their followers.


Thousands of different cults exist. Destructive cults include apocalyptic groups such as “Heaven’s Gate”


in which 38 followers committed mass suicide after the UFO that was to usher in the end of world failed to arrive. Other cults have political, social and religious, motivations, such as the “People’s Temple” infamous for the 1978 “Jonestown Massacre” in which over 900 followers committed “revolutionary suicide” by drinking poisoned drink mix at the urging of the Reverend Jim Jones. Although “Flavor Aid” was the actual drink brand used in the poisonings, the phrase “Don’t drink the Kool-Aid” became culturally iconic when referring to unquestioned beliefs related to political or religious agendas.
   Cult members use a variety of techniques to control and manipulate potential followers. Cults are usually isolated and exert considerable control over communication with the outside world. They use intense indoctrination techniques often referred to by the popular culture as “brain washing” or “mind control.” They employ intense and cunning emotional manipulation; use guilt, shame, and fear tactics; subject recruits to emotionally charged meetings and rituals lasting for hours; and use sleep deprivation and other forms of influence to convert recruits. Cults dictate and control how followers should think, act, and feel. These practices are so effective that followers give up all they have and all they are to the cult.
   Cults most frequently target young adults for recruitment. This is a stage in life when young adults are seeking their own self and spiritual identity distinct from that of their parents. This leaves them especially vulnerable to charismatic leaders who “have all the answers” and “know the one way.” Young adults are emotionally manipulated and made to feel especially understood, accepted, and cared for increasing their vulnerability to recruitment and eventual conversion.
   Cults are powerful and destructive social phenomenon, and awareness of their tactics is especially important for young adults. Becoming knowledgeable of the beliefs and practices of any religious group, or NRM, before becoming involved is an essential safeguard of one’s spiritual and psychological well-being.






Cultural competence is increasingly important in the helping professions of counseling and psychotherapy. It is the capacity to recognize and respond appropriately to the needs and concerns of individuals from other cultures. There are four dimensions of cultural competence: cultural knowledge, cultural awareness, cultural sensitivity, and cultural action. Briefly, cultural knowledge is acquaintance with facts about ethnicity, social class, acculturation, religion, gender, and age. Cultural awareness builds on cultural knowledge. It includes the capacity to recognize a cultural

Cultural competence is the ability to interact effectively with individuals from other cultures. It is also known as multicultural competence and intercultural competence.


• Cultural competence is the capacity to recognize, respect, and respond with appropriate words and actions to the needs and concerns of individuals from different ethnicities, social classes, genders, ages, or religions.
• Cultural encapsulation is a way of relating to another from one’s own biased worldview and perspective.
• Cultural incompetence refers to acting from one’s culturally encapsulated perspective and failing to consider the other’s worldview.
• Culture refers to the values, norms, and traditions that affect how individuals of a particular group perceive, think, act, interact, and make judgments about their world.
• Multicultural counseling is an approach to counseling clients that is responsive to their cultural beliefs and the effect these beliefs can have on their treatment.
• Worldview refers to basic assumptions that individuals and groups have about other people and the world. It defines one’s cultural perspective.

problem or issue in a specific client situation. Cultural sensitivity is an extension of cultural awareness. It also involves the capacity to anticipate likely consequences of a particular cultural problem or issue and to respond empathically. Cultural action follows from cultural sensitivity. It is the capacity to translate cultural sensitivity into action that results in an effective outcome. The higher one’s level of culturally competence increases the more likely one will make appropriate decisions and take effective cultural action in a given situation.
   Possessing only basic cultural knowledge, awareness, sensitivity and skillful, actions is insufficient to function effectively in a multicultural world. A low level of cultural competence is evident when one demonstrates deficits in these requisite components, is unable to perceive the need to apply them, or is unable to do so. In contrast, a high level of cultural competence is evident when one knows, recognizes, respects, accepts and welcomes, and takes effective and appropriate skillful action with regard to another’s culture. In other words, cultural competence requires both sufficiency of its basic components and the proficiency to implement them.
   Individuals vary in their capacity for demonstrating cultural competence. In fact, cultural competence has been conceptualized as a continuum ranging from a very low level of cultural competence at one end to a very high level of cultural competence at the other end. For example, a low level of cultural competence is called cultural incompetence. It reflects a lack of or minimal acquaintance and recognition of cultural knowledge and cultural awareness. Because there is





a lack of cultural sensitivity, one’s cultural decisions and actions are likely to be inappropriate, ineffective, or even harmful or destructive. Individuals are likely to be culturally encapsulated. Besides a failure to understand the worldview and cultural identity of another, it is the failure to incorporate whatever cultural knowledge one might have of the other into interactions with others. In contrast, a high level of cultural competence reflects more cultural knowledge and awareness, and there is no indication of cultural encapsulation.

Developments and Current Status
Awareness of cultural factors in mental health is the basis of what is called the multicultural movement in counseling. In 1962, psychologist Gilbert Wrenn (1902–2001) described the culturally encapsulated counselor and how such counselors negatively impacted culturally different or minority clients. The movement gained momentum with psychologist Stanley Sue’s (n.d.) 1977 article in which he indicated that minority clients received unequal and poor mental health services. In 1978 psychologist Derald Wing Sue (n.d.) described the term “worldview” and its influence on counseling. Soon after, the first edition of Derald Sue’s book Counseling the Culturally Different appeared in 1981. It provided background on several different minority groups and became the model for similar books. Sue’s book is now in its sixth edition. It has the distinction of being the most frequently cited publication in multicultural psychology. This book is estimated to be used in nearly 50% of the graduate counseling and psychology courses. In 1992, Darryl Sue and colleagues identified 31 standards of cultural competence arranged in three categories: awareness of one’s own worldview, knowledge of the worldviews of culturally different clients, and skills needed to work with such clients. In a recent series of articles and book chapters, psychiatrist and psychologist Len Sperry (1943–) distinguished the four components of cultural competency: cultural knowledge, cultural awareness, cultural sensitivity, and cultural action.



Culturally sensitive treatment is a medical or psychotherapeutic treatment that is sensitive to the client’s culture.


• Acculturation is the degree to which individuals integrate new cultural patterns into their original cultural patterns.
• Clinician credibility is the culturally diverse individual’s perception that the practitioner is effective and trustworthy based on how the practitioner instills faith, trust, and confidence in the client for the treatment process and outcomes.
• Cultural identity is an individual’s self-identification and perceived sense of belonging to a particular culture or place of origin.
• Cultural sensitivity refers to practitioners’ awareness of cultural variables in themselves and in their clients that may affect the professional relationship and treatment process.
• Culture refers to the values, norms, and traditions that affect how individuals of a particular group perceive, think, act, interact, and make judgments about their world.





Even though most practitioners believe that culturally sensitive treatments are important in providing effective care to culturally diverse clients, very few practitioners actually provide such treatment. The most common reason for this omission is that few have had formal training and experience with these competencies. Such treatments include cultural intervention, culturally sensitive therapy, and culturally sensitive interventions.


A cultural intervention is an intervention that is useful in effecting a specified change because it is consistent with the individual’s belief system regarding healing. Examples include healing circles, healing prayer, exorcism, and involvement of traditional healers from that client’s culture.
   Culturally sensitive therapy is a psychotherapeutic intervention that directly focuses on the individual’s cultural beliefs, customs, and attitudes. Since this therapy utilizes traditional healing methods, such approaches are appealing to certain clients. Examples include “cuento therapy,” which focuses on “familismo” and “personalismo” through the use of folk tales (“cuentos”). “Morita therapy” is a therapy used for various disorders ranging from shyness to schizophrenia and is particularly effective in those with lower levels of acculturation.
   A culturally sensitive intervention is a psychotherapeutic intervention that has been adapted or modified to be responsive to the cultural characteristics of a particular client. Cognitive behavior therapy is the most common of such intervention because it is structured, educationally focused, and easily modified to be culturally sensitive. For example, disputation and cognitive restructuring are not effective with individuals with lower levels of acculturation. However, culturally sensitive problem solving, skills training, and cognitive replacement interventions are more appropriate and effective.

• Acculturative stress is the stress experienced when struggling to adapt to a new culture psychologically and socially and its impact on health status.
• Clinician credibility is the culturally diverse individual’s perception that the practitioner is effective and trustworthy based on how the practitioner instills faith, trust, and confidence in the client for the treatment process and outcomes.
• Cultural competence is the capacity to recognize, respect, and respond with appropriate words and actions to the needs and concerns of individuals from different ethnicities, social classes, genders, ages, or religions.
• Cultural diversity is the presence of a number of diverse or different cultures within a society. It is also known as cultural pluralism.
• Cultural identity is an individual’s self-identification and perceived sense of





belonging to a particular culture or place of origin.
• Cultural sensitivity is the practitioners’ awareness of cultural variables in themselves and in their clients that may affect the professional relationship and treatment process.
• Culture-bound syndromes are recurrent, patterned, and problematic behaviors or experiences that are specific to a geographical region or culture.
• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Indigenous medicine is a cultural system of practicing medicine that was developed prior to modern medicine and is part of a cultural heritage. It is also known as folk medicine and traditional medicine.
• Multicultural counseling is a form of psychotherapy in which the therapist and client (individual, couple, or family) who are of different cultural backgrounds collaborate in a psychotherapeutic relationship.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.



Culture is frequently conceptualized (thought about) as a way of categorizing different approaches to living. Cultural differences include heritage, customs, language, values, and beliefs. They also include ethnicities, races, and religious beliefs. Furthermore, cultural differences exist between social classes, gender identities, sexual orientations, and age groups. Artifacts or objects that are distinct to a group of people are also part of culture. For example, particular food, clothing, and housing norms may differ from group to group. These are the various ways in which culture is defined.


   Cultural identity is the sense of belonging to a particular cultural group or place of origin. Cultural identity affects one’s psychological experience of living. As a result, the mental health professions have integrated cultural sensitivity into their work. Cultural sensitivity is an ethical requirement of the profession. Cultural sensitivity requires basic knowledge and awareness of cultural factors and how they impact individuals. A culturally competent psychotherapist is aware of, knowledgeable about, and sensitive to a range of diverse human behaviors and experiences. This cultural competence is especially relevant to multicultural counseling. In the United States, the therapist and client are often members of different cultural groups. Effective psychotherapy accommodates cultural factors. Cultural factors influence the ways in which a client’s presenting problem is expressed and understood. Psychotherapeutic interventions that are culturally sensitive lead to better treatment outcomes. Culturally sensitive psychotherapy includes an assessment of acculturation. Acculturative stress occurs when an immigrant experiences difficulty integrating new cultural patterns with his or her original cultural patterns. In addition, clients from cultures with histories of being oppressed may have difficulty trusting a therapist from cultural groups other than their own.


Nearly every cultural group throughout history has practiced the art and science of restoring health. Contemporary mental health practices are informed by this ancient heritage. Practitioners of indigenous medicine are more likely to work on healing physical, psychological, social, or spiritual ailments. In contrast, modern health-care professionals have become increasingly specialized in the practice of medicine. At the end of the 19th century, psychology established itself as a distinct profession. However, cultural considerations in the mental health professions were largely ignored until the middle of the 20th century. At that time the third major mental health reform was under way. The third major mental health reform was called the Community Mental Health Movement. The Community Mental Health Movement was a backlash against institutionalization and led to greater social integration.





Alexander H. Leighton (1908–2007) and Dorothea C. Leighton (1908–1989) were pioneers in culturally sensitive mental health research and practice. Their observations of indigenous healers illuminated similarities and differences between many traditional and modern healthcare practices.
   One of the major differences between indigenous and mainstream American culture is culture-bound syndromes. Until 1967 they were considered peculiar psychiatric disorders. Today, these syndromes are considered to be illnesses or afflictions that are specific to a given culture. The first culture-bound syndrome identified is amok and is associated with Malaysian culture. Amok describes a period of brooding followed by assaultive or murderous behavior. It is usually precipitated by a perceived insult or slight. Often, culture-bound syndromes are believed by the cultural group to be caused by evil spirits. There are many culture-bound syndromes listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
   The mental health professions have become increasingly sensitive to the impact of culture on psychotherapy since the 1950s. Culturally sensitive and evidence-based mental health practices have become more common. The surgeon general of the United States reported on the contributions of such research efforts in 2001. However, in the same report the surgeon general noted that major insufficiencies in cultural knowledge still existed. Mental health care for populations of cultural minorities is still not sufficiently evidence based. Modern science allows contemporary multicultural interventions to study the integration of traditional and modern treatments. Evidence-based treatments have been proven to produce therapeutic change in the controlled contexts of scientific research. However, the majority of evidence-based psychotherapy research does not emphasize cultural sensitivity. Counseling research has largely been based on white male middle-class American culture. The results of these scientific studies and resultant treatments might not be generalizable to members of cultural minority groups. Interventions that were invented in one culture may not be applicable across cultural barriers. The increasing diversity in the United States requires that evidence-based treatments be reevaluated for use with various cultural groups. Insensitivity to cultural


factors in psychotherapy can lead to misunderstanding, conflict, oppression, and a minimization of positive outcomes. Common cultural differences leading to therapeutic obstacles include social class, gender, and sexual orientation. It is not surprising that dropout rates in psychotherapy are higher for culturally diverse clients than for clients in the cultural majority. Culturally sensitive therapeutic approaches have been developed to better serve the needs of culturally diverse clients.



Custody explores the rights of the parent or guardian over children. The primary purpose of an evaluation is to assess the best psychological interest of the child. In separation or divorce, custody evaluations review who has residential or primary care of the child or children as well as identify visitation rights and expectations. Custody evaluations are conducted to help determine which parent or caregiver best meets the child’s needs and are generally conducted by a child psychologist appointed by the court or guardian ad litem (GAL).



Custody evaluations have not always been as complicated and challenging as they currently are. Prior to the turn of the 20th century, children were automatically put into the care of their fathers as it was believed the fathers could care for children better financially. However, the industrial revolution brought to light the mother’s role in child care. This led to a belief that younger children were better in their mother’s care, resulting in a switch toward favoring mothers in custody disputes.
   The 1960s to current day has brought attention to focusing on the best interest of the child as opposed to the gender of the parent. The 1970s introduced the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act, which was adopted by the majority of states. This act focused on the best interest of the child and identified several factors that should be considered. These factors include parental preference regarding custody, the desire of the child, interactions and relationships of the child with the parent as well as siblings and any other person who could be involved in the adjustment of the child, and the mental and physical health of the parents as well as any other relevant factors. However, in the two decades mothers still predominately receive primary custody of the children in custody agreements.
   Anyone the child resides with or who is responsible for caring for the child is a part of the child custody evaluation. This includes both natural parents and significant others such as stepparents, live-in partners, grandparents, and live-in help. The process includes interviews and observations, as well as cognitive and personality functioning tests. Information is obtained from school records, medical records, and legal and court records as well as from any relevant party involved. For instance, teachers may be interviewed for their perception of interactions and parental investment.
   The purpose of the evaluation is the fitness of the parent. The evaluator and courts are looking at the emotional, financial, and residential stability. Any psychiatric hospitalizations and use of psychotropic


medication, as well as the reasons for therapy can all be assessed. Any drug or alcohol-related problems will also be evaluated. The evaluator will also look at what parents can best support the child academically as well as for needs of daily living. Cooperation both with the other parent and the courts is assessed as well as behavior during meetings. The parent’s social skills and judgment are also explored, as well as the interaction between the child and parent and their ability to communicate openly. These factors are all incorporated into the Ackerman-Schoendorf Scales for Parent Evaluation of Custody (ASPECT and ASPECT-SF).
   The evaluation is generally completed by a child psychologist and may work in collaboration with an adult psychologist. Ideally it should be a single professional completing the evaluation. The evaluator should have a doctorate in psychology and be licensed in that state. Traditionally both parents would hire an expert to evaluate them separately. Due to the cost and time of this, there has been a shift to court-appointed evaluators who serve both parents. Some states, however, still use the traditional method. It is common now that the evaluator be appointed either by the court or by a GAL. The evaluator works as a team member with the GAL as they are obligated to make recommendations based on best interest of the child.

Currently child custody evaluations have a purpose of assessing the best psychological interest of the child as well as the child’s well-being. There is a focus on the developing needs of the child as well and the ability of the parent to meet those needs.




Cutting is a form of self-injury whereby one makes cuts on his or her body, usually on the arms or legs, without attempting to commit suicide.


• Deliberate self-harm, or self-inflicted injury, refers to acts of harming oneself with non-suicidal intent.
• Self-inflicted injury is a term used to refer to a range of behaviors that encompass self-harm where one deliberately injures oneself but without suicidal intentions.


• Self-injury, also referred to as self-harm, is the act of intentionally harming one’s own body (by cutting or burning), without the intention of committing suicide.


Cutting is considered a type of deliberate self-harm or self-injury. A person who engages in cutting behavior intends to hurt himself or herself but does not do it with the intention of committing suicide. Rather, this type of self-harm is used as an unhealthy way to cope with emotional pain, anger, or frustration. However, as with any form of self-inflicted injury, there is the possibility of more serious and even fatal consequences.




Cutting is a form of self-injury whereby an individual makes cuts on his or her body with sharp objects such as razor blades, usually on the arms or legs. Cutting is not a suicide attempt but is rather a maladaptive coping mechanism for dealing with stress, anxiety, or other negative emotions. (Axel Bueckert/Dreamstime.com)





   When a person cuts, he or she usually makes small, shallow incisions, using a razor or other sharp object, on his or her legs or arms. Typically these cuts are made in places that are not readily visible to family or friends. Cutting behavior is associated with an inability to cope and regulate one’s impulses. It has been linked to a variety of mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Perfectionistic tendencies among some cutters have also been noted. People who self-injure have often experienced some form of abuse, physical, verbal, emotional, and/ or sexual.
   Cutters report that the act helps them to get rid of negative emotions, release endorphins, and/or gain some sense of control. Though feelings of calm or an easing of tension may result immediately on cutting oneself, this is often replaced later by feelings of guilt or shame. Oftentimes, cutting behaviors are associated with long-term psychological issues such as anxiety and depression. People who cut are also more likely to have experienced some form of abuse, physical, emotional, and/or sexual, in their past. Cutting behavior is a behavioral sign of deeper, underlying problems, and thus, treatment for this type of behavior should be sought out immediately. Consultation with a pediatrician or health-care provider may be the first step. Follow-up treatment may include working on behavior and proper coping skills with a counselor or therapist and/or medication.


Research estimates that adolescents and young adults, ranging in age from 12 years to early 30s, report cutting behaviors most often. Children as young as nine years have reported cutting. Females are more likely to be cutters than males. Cutting and other forms of self-injurious behavior have been identified across all cultures and socioeconomic statuses. Though the practice of cutting may have existed in secrecy for some time, recent media attention has caused a rise in the number of young people who engage in this form of self-injury. To further complicate the matter, there have been relatively few research studies done on


cutting which makes definitive statistics on the subject hard to come by.

“Cyberbullying” refers to using electronic technology (cell phones, computers, tablets, gaming devices) to repeatedly and intentionally degrade, threaten, or humiliate another person.


• Bullycide refers to a suicide where the victim’s death has been attributed to his or her having been bullied either in person or online.
• Bullying describes deliberate, repeated acts of aggression that are inflicted directly or indirectly over time by one or more dominant persons.
• Mobbing defines when an individual is bullied by a group of people in any context, including a family, school, social setting, or workplace.


Using technology and electronic communication as a means to threaten, harm, humiliate, or intimidate another person is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is a distinct type of bullying or peer aggression. Technology devices such as computers, cell phones, tablets, or gaming devices can be used as vehicles for bullying behavior. Those who cyberbully may do so through calling, texting, e-mailing, instant messaging, posting comments, making

verbal/written threats on social media and gaming sites, or taking pictures and transmitting them electronically. Canadian educator and anti-bullying activist, Bill Belsey, is credited with coining the term “cyberbullying.”
   Certain characteristics of cyberbullying make it more difficult to identify and report, given that the incidents do not happen in person as is the case with other forms including physical, verbal, or relational bullying. Anonymity is an issue as there is no way to be certain of the true identity of the aggressor. Temporary e-mail accounts, using pseudonames, anonymous postings, or sending messages from another


person’s phone or computer can be accomplished nowadays with little trouble. Another characteristic that contributes to the ease of cyberbullying is lack of supervision. While teachers, administrators, and staff can deter bullying from occurring in schools simply by their presence, close monitoring of electronic devices and proper Internet usage during personal time is more complicated. In addition, parents may not be as technologically savvy as their children, making it more difficult for them to adequately supervise their usage. Furthermore, the simplicity of accessing mobile devices, particularly smartphones with Internet capabilities, has made cyberbullying an around-the-clock issue. Homes are no longer safe havens, and aggressors can target their victims anywhere and anytime. The level of impact in terms of the number of people that can be reached through cyberbullying also makes it distinct from other types of bullying. Mobbing, or bullying by a group of people rather than an individual, can be accomplished almost effortlessly through group messages, chat rooms, and social networking sites. These factors also contribute to the lasting impact this type of harassment can have on an individual’s emotional and psychological well-being.
Cyberbullying can result in serious consequences.
Victims often report higher levels of fear, anxiety, and stress. In addition, those who have been cyberbullied have lower self-esteem, may become socially withdrawn/isolated, and are at greater risk for depression and suicide. The term “bullycide” has been used to refer to suicides where bullying was determined to be a primary contributing factor. Cases such as that of Ryan Halligan (2003), Megan Meier (2006), Pheobe Prince (2010), and Tyler Clementi (2010) brought media attention to the detrimental effects of cyberbullying specifically.


Since the 1990s there has been a rise in reported incidents of cyberbullying as society’s reliance on technology has increased. Recent reports indicate that the majority of teens aged 12 to 17, approximately 95%, access the Internet on a regular basis. Smartphones, which have become an increasingly popular vehicle used for social interactions, permit users to go online from any location at any time of the day. Research has





found that most parents are concerned with what information their child may access or share online. Given this fact and the relative ease with which cyberbullying occurs, certain measures should be taken to help combat this growing problem. Experts agree that close monitoring can prevent and reduce cyberbullying. They recommend that parents discuss online etiquette and what constitutes appropriate sharing of information with their children and that they educate them about cyberbullying and its consequences as well as what to do if they see this behavior occurring. Parents are also encouraged to require their children to keep computers, tablets, and other devices in a centrally located, open room in the house to deter youngsters from engaging in negative interactions themselves or hiding the inappropriate behaviors of others.



Cyclothymic disorder is a mental disorder characterized by alternating cycles of hypomanic and depressive symptoms.



• Bipolar and related disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by changes in mood and in energy (e.g., being highly irritable and impulsive while not needing sleep). These disorders include bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder.
• Bipolar disorders is a mental disorder characterized by a history of manic episodes (bipolar I disorder), mixed, or hypomanic episodes (bipolar II disorder), usually with one or more major depressive episodes.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Depression is a sad mood or emotional state that is characterized by feelings of low self-worth or guilt and a reduced ability to enjoy life. It is not considered a mental disorder unless it significantly disrupts the individual’s daily functioning.
• Depressive disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a sad or irritable mood and cognitive and physical changes that significantly disrupt the individual’s daily functioning. These disorders include major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
• Hypomania is a mental state similar to mania but less intense.
• Major depressive disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a depressed mood and other symptoms that interfere significantly with an individual’s daily functioning. It is also referred to as clinical depression.
• Mania is a mental state of expansive, elevated, or irritable mood with increased energy or activity.





• SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. They are a class of antidepressant medications that work by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin in nerve cells and raising its level in the brain.

Cyclothymic disorder is one of a group of depressive disorders. It is characterized by a chronic fluctuating mood with distinct periods of hypomanic symptoms and distinct periods of depressive symptoms. The symptoms are like those of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder but of lesser severity. Cyclothymic disorder is similar to bipolar II disorder. It is seen in individuals unable to regulate their emotions effectively. They may lack the willingness to think beyond themselves, consider their impact on others, and take the initiative in meeting their responsibilities. This disorder usually begins early in life. It appears to be equally common in men and women although women are more likely to seek treatment for it than men (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a pattern of chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms. These fluctuating depressive and hypomanic symptoms must be distinct from one another and have lasted at least two years. The hypomania and depression is not sufficient to warrant either a bipolar I or II diagnosis, yet sufficient to disrupts one’s ability to function efficiently (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is not well understood. However, there is some evidence for genetic and physiological factors as causes or triggers for it (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Since this disorder runs in families, there appears to be a genetic basis for it. Major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymic disorder often occur together in families. This suggests that these mood disorders share similar causes. These individuals also tend to have skill deficits in emotion regulation.


Effective treatment of this disorder usually involves psychotherapy and medication. Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), can be quite helpful in increasing emotional regulation. The challenge is to better manage daily life challenges. CBT helps those with this disorder in three ways. The first is develop better emotion regulation skills. The second is to identify unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with more healthy and positive ones. The third is to identify triggers to both hypomanic and depressive episodes and better cope with upsetting situations. Medication may be helpful in emotional regulation. Medications like Lithium, Depakote, and Tegretol are particularly useful in regulating and stabilizing mood.
Cymbalta (Duloxetine)

Cymbalta is a prescribed medication used to treat depression and neuropathic pain. Its generic name is duloxetine.


• Antidepressant medications are prescription drugs that are primarily used to treat





depression and depressive disorders. They are known as antidepressants.
• Neuropathic pain is pain generated by the nervous system. It is also called neurogenic pain.
• Selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRI) are medications that act on and increase the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain that influences mood. They differ from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which act only on serotonin.
• Serotonin discontinuation syndrome is a condition caused by abrupt discontinuation of an SNRI resulting in withdrawal symptoms. These include flu-like symptoms, anxiety, agitation, vivid or bizarre dreams, insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, numbness and tingling of the extremities. This syndrome can be avoided by dose reduction over time.
• Serotonin syndrome is a serious medication reaction resulting from an excess of serotonin in the brain. It occurs when a number of medications that increase serotonin are taken together. Symptoms include high blood pressure, high fever, headache, delirium, shock, and coma.


Cymbalta belongs to a class of antidepressant medications known as selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRI). It is used to treat various disorders, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia. SSN-RIs specifically act on two chemicals called serotonin and norepinephrine. It is believed that a decrease in serotonin and norepinephrine contributes to depression, anxiety, and pain. SSNRIs work by counteracting this by increasing the actions of both neurotransmitters. An increase of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain is believed to reduce depressive symptoms, while an increase of both in the spinal cord reduces pain associated with diabetic neuropathy or fibromyalgia. Cymbalta has a high success rate in treating depression and


is often the first SSNRI to be prescribed. Cymbalta can be used alone or in combination with other medications depending on the medical condition and the individual’s health history.


Antidepressant drugs, including Cymbalta, have been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and adults up to age 24. Any patient taking an antidepressant drug should be monitored for changes in behavior and worsening depression. If treatment with Cymbalta is ceased, it should be slowly discontinued to avoid the development of SNRI discontinuation syndrome. Close medical monitoring is needed if Cymbalta is used with those with liver or kidney function impairment, seizure disorder, bleeding disorders, glaucoma, dehydration, and history of alcohol abuse and in patients younger than 25 years of age or those over 60 years. Cymbalta should be used only for a short time and with careful monitoring in those with bipolar disorder as it can induce mania. The safety of Cymbalta use during pregnancy and breast-feeding is unknown, so its use is not recommended.
   Because SSNRIs have fewer side effects than SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, they tend to be the drug of choice in treating depression. Nevertheless, side effects may still occur. The most common are nausea, headache, dizziness, constipation, sexual dysfunction, diarrhea, sweating, dry mouth, shakiness, loss of appetite, hot flashes, high blood pressure, yawning, anxiety, and insomnia. Rare but serious side effects include mania, worsened depression and suicidality, seizures, serotonin syndrome, SNRI discontinuation syndrome, electrolyte imbalances, urinary retention, skin reactions, abnormal bleeding, liver damage, and glaucoma.
   To reduce the likelihood of serotonin syndrome, Cymbalta should not be combined with antipsychotics like Thorazine or Prolixin or herbal supplements such as Yohimbine, ginkgo biloba, and St. John’s wort. Drug interactions may occur when alcohol, Haldol, or NSAIDs are taken with Cymbalta. Other medications that can cause drug interactions with Cymbalta include Tagamet, Lithium, Inderal, and anticoagulant medicines. Others include diuretics (water pills), diet pills





such as Meridia, caffeine, antibiotics such as Cipro, mood stabilizers such as Lithium, antipsychotics such as Haldol and Clozaril, and antiseizure medications like Dilantin. There is increased risk of internal bleeding when Cymbalta is used with anticoagulant drugs such as aspirin and warfarin, and large doses of the herbal supplements red clover, ginkgo biloba, fever-few, or green tea.




































Jeffrey Dahmer was a sexual predator and serial killer notorious for cannibalizing, that is, eating, many of his victims. He killed 17 males between 1978 and 1991, and was sentenced to 15 consecutive life terms in 1992. On November 28, 1994, he was murdered by a prison inmate.


Dahmer was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on May 21, 1960, to Lionel and Joyce Dahmer. His early upbringing was unremarkable until age 6, when he underwent minor surgery to correct a double hernia, and his brother was born. He is said to have become socially withdrawn and less self-confident. After high school, he enrolled in college but dropped out after one-quarter because of drinking and failure to attend class. Then he enlisted in the army but was dishonorably discharged because of his alcoholism. When his army superior berated him and said he would never amount to anything, Dahmer is reported to have said, “Just wait and see, someday everyone will know me.”
   As an adult, Dahmer appeared to blend in easily in the middle-class neighborhood in which he lived. He was described as a quiet but likeable young man who held a job. At that same time he was a killer and sexual predator who murdered men and boys—most of whom were of African or Asian descent. Dahmer’s murders were particularly gruesome because they involving rape, torture, dismemberment, necrophilia, and cannibalism. By the summer of 1991, Dahmer was murdering approximately one person each week and probably would have continued had he not finally been arrested after police searched his apartment.


The story of Dahmer’s arrest and the inventory in his apartment quickly gained national and international attention. Many were shocked to learn that several corpses were stored in acid-filled vats, and materials for an altar of candles and human skulls were found in his closet. Seven skulls were found in the apartment and a human heart was recovered from his freezer. Like many facile psychopaths, Dahmer had managed to avoid detection for years because of his uncanny ability to deceive police, parole personnel, and even mental health professionals with highly plausible stories and explanations.
   He would entice victims to his apartment where he would drug them, strangle them, and then engage in various deviant sexual behaviors with the corpse prior to dismembering and eating it, at least parts of it. The key to this deadly sequence was drugging his victims, usually with benzodiazepines like Valium and Ativan or sleep-inducing medications like Ambien. Dahmer would grind the pills and mix them with coffee which he persuaded his victims to drink. The source of these pills were various physicians, including some psychiatrists with extensive training in forensics. He would complain of difficulty with anxiety and sleeplessness and convince these doctors that he really needed these medications. The fact that he had a long history of chronic alcoholism, dating from his high school and army days, should have been a contraindication to prescribing such medications. Nevertheless, he was consistently successful in conning physicians to provide him with the means to kill his next victims.

gruesome and evil as to strangle, kill, sexually abuse, and cannibalize their victims like Dahmer. Jeffrey Dahmer appears to have made good on his promise to his army superior that “someday everyone will know about me.”






Dance therapy is the psychotherapeutic use of movement to promote emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual. It has been shown to be an effective therapeutic treatment by improving the well-being of those with social, physical, and/or psychological challenges.

Dance therapy has been utilized as a healing ritual for thousands of years. Although dance therapy finds its roots among indigenous people, it wasn’t formalized into a specific treatment modality until the 20th century. Thus, dance therapy is considered to be a relatively new practice; however, it has already been shown to be a viable treatment for a wide variety of mental and physical challenges.
   For example, dance therapy has been studied as a treatment for dementia, depression, alcoholism, heart disease, diabetes, and many more mental and physical ailments—often with statistically significant positive results. It is important to note that there has long been a connection between therapy and dance; however, as a formal discipline, it remains a fairly new approach. With the growing development of counseling theories and techniques, new ways of treating mental health challenges are being identified. Dance therapy, depending on the theoretical perspective of the therapist, is conducted either individually or in a group format. Regardless of perspective, the participant’s dance identity must be considered. Dance therapy has been identified as an alternative medicine by the National Institute of Mental Health as it is an expression of the mind and body. Movement reflects personality and has an advantage over traditional talk therapy since it includes assessment of the nonverbal body movements.
Dance therapy is considered to have a positive impact
on a person’s well-being.





   There are two models that tend to be the most commonly utilized by practitioners. The first is Dance/ Movement Therapy, which was developed in the United States during the 1940s. This model has been widely accepted by dance therapists in the United States. This model has its roots in modern dance tradition and encourages movement without any form of limitation. Here, the emphasis is on body-self, body weight, knowledge of the body, and creation of a safe space. This therapy is conducted either individually or in a group format.
   The other model is Expression Primitive, which originated in France in 1984. This model came from the French Society of Dance Therapy. The view of this model is that dance therapy is ritualistic and present in every aspect of life. Dance is conducted in a group format with the individual following verbal or physical directives given by the therapist.
   These two models are distinct from one another, and those in the field tend to choose the model they identify with and often question the effectiveness of the other. One large difference between the two is that The American perspective is that dance occurs under special conditions. The focus of disagreement between the two models is also focused on the differences in the forms of dance.


Dance therapy is currently a supported form of alternative medicine by the National Institute of Mental Health. It has also been accepted by the Association for Creativity in Counseling, which is a recognized division of the American Counseling Association. Current research has found support for its effectiveness with specific disorders, such as eating disorders and alcoholism.



Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness was written by William Styron (1925–2006) and published in 1990. Although an abridged version of the book was originally published in 1989 in the magazine Vanity Fair, the origins can be traced back to a lecture the author gave on affective disorders at the Department of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Medicine. This first-person account of his near-fatal descent into depression is considered one of the most vivid and insightful, even after more than 25 years since it was first published. The title of Styron’s book is highly symbolic; it was taken from John Milton’s description of hell in Paradise Lost.





   William Styron was considered among the greatest American writers of his time following the release of his first novel, Lie Down in Darkness, published in 1952 when he was just 26 years old. He won a Pulitzer Prize for his second novel, The Confessions of Nat Turner, and his 1979 novel Sophie’s Choice was made into an Academy Award–nominated movie in 1982 and an opera in 2002. However, he may be best known for his 1990 personal memoir of depression, Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness, which became a national best seller in 1990.
   The impact of Darkness Visible has yet to wane, even though decades have passed since its original



Prominent American author William Styron’s 1990 memoir, Darkness Visible, chronicled his terrible struggles with depression. 


publishing. Although just 85 pages, the clarity of Styron’s description of his depressive condition led to the book being embraced by both critics and mental health professionals alike. At the time, the memoir was considered groundbreaking in that it served to greatly increase knowledge about major depressive disorders and the often-accompanying act of suicide. It also helped to decrease the stigma and shame associated with depression that had long been kept silent among its sufferers.
   Styron chronicles the rapid onset of his depression and blames the abrupt end to years of alcohol abuse in combination with a prescription of Halcion (triazolam). Although he never attempted suicide, he painfully shares his intense suicidal ideation that kept him bedridden for months and ultimately led to his hospitalization.
   One of the most valuable contributions of Styron’s memoir is that it was the first book to help break the silence surrounding depression and refuted the idea that depression was suffered mainly by weak-minded individuals, especially those who attempted or completed suicide. However, perhaps the greatest impact of Darkness Visible is the message that no matter how severe depression may get, hope and even redemption is possible through perseverance.




The term “date rape” refers to an act of sexual assault perpetrated by a person with whom the victim has been acquainted with (not a stranger). It is also referred to as “acquaintance rape.”


• Consent is an act of voluntary willingness.
• Rape occurs when sexual intercourse (vagina, anus, or mouth) is not consensual, or the perpetrator forces himself on the victim sexually against the victim’s will.
• Sexual assault is an involuntary sexual act whereby a person is forced to engage in any type of sexual activity (touching, kissing, sexual penetration) against his or her will; it is used in legal terminology to refer to a statutory offense.


“Date rape” refers to an act of nonconsensual sexual intercourse that is committed by a person the victim knows, usually a friend or acquaintance. It is also referred to as “acquaintance rape” or “drug-induced sexual assault.” Date rape is distinguished from rape in that the victim knows the attacker socially. The victim may even have been involved in a romantic relationship with the attacker. Both men and women can be victims of date rape. Incidents of date rape oftentimes occur when the victim is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Rohypnol and gamma-hydroxybutyrate are considered “date rape drugs” and have been linked to these cases of sexual assault. Date rape is a serious crime and is classified as a felony offense. Victims of date rape suffer from physical and emotional abuse.


Date rape is much more common than incidents of rape perpetrated by a stranger. Estimates suggest that 80%–85% of all reported rapes can be classified as date rape. However, instances of date rape are also underreported

All forms of rape can have profound psychological consequences, including depression, anxiety, feelings of shame, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 



as victims may not recognize these acts as a crime. Feelings of guilt over not knowing what happened, perhaps due to drugs or alcohol, are also contributing factors. The United States Bureau of Justice indicated that 38% of reported rapes were perpetrated by a friend or acquaintance, and in 28% of cases, the attacker was considered “an intimate,” while in 7% of the cases the attacker was “a relative” 







Dating is social courting done by two people who each want to see if the other is a possible intimate relationship partner or spouse. Flirting includes verbal and nonverbal communication by one person to another that suggests an interest in a physical or romantic relationship with the other person.


Social rules regarding dating vary according to variables such as country, social class, religion, age, sexual orientation, and gender. Behavior patterns of dating and flirting are generally unwritten and constantly changing. There are considerable differences between social and personal values. Each culture has particular patterns that determine flirting and dating norms. These include choices such as whether the man asks the woman out and where people might meet. Other questions include whether kissing is acceptable on a first date and who should pay for meals or entertainment. Depending on where you live and who you are, the social choices and questions involved are complex. The term “dating” most commonly refers to a trial period in which two people explore each other. Dating can also refer to the time when people are physically together in public as opposed to the earlier time period in which people are arranging the date, perhaps through corresponding by e-mail or text or phone. Another meaning of the term “dating” is to describe a stage in a person’s life when he or she is actively pursuing romantic relationships with different people.


   One of the main purposes of dating is for two or more people to evaluate one another’s suitability as a possible long-term companion or spouse. Often physical characteristics, personality, financial status, and other aspects are judged and as a result feelings can be hurt and confidence shaken. Dating can be stressful for those involved because of the uncertainty of the future, the desire to be acceptable to the other person, and the possibility of rejection. Dating often lets those involved get a chance to decide where to take the relationship. If the dating experience is positive, two people usually move into a more permanent or committed relationship.
   Flirting requires several different skills that involve body language, empathy, and creativity. Flirting can be used either in trying to find someone to date or in trying to get a desired object or outcome in a situation. Research has been conducted on flirting techniques used in bars, malls, and other places where young people go to meet each other. Results of this research indicate that it is not the most physically appealing people who get approached but the ones who send specific signs. These people signal their availability and confidence through basic techniques like eye contact and smiles. Signaling your interest in someone gets you halfway there, whether you’re a man or a woman.
   Two types of flirting exist and are fairly universal. Smiling and eye contact indicate flirting and are effective in most places and for most people. But an even more effective flirting technique is touch. Research has been done to identify which types of touching are flirting, such as touching the shoulder, waist, forearm, and, most intimately, the face. Flirting can be done to let another person know you’re interested in him or her romantically or sexually. It usually occurs before and during the dating process. Touching that is gentle and informal, and that occurs face-to-face or involves hugging, lets someone else know that the person intends to continue pursuing the relationship.


There are some identifiable differences in the ways that men and women in heterosexual relationships date and flirt. Research suggests that men prefer women who seem to be flexible and admired. Men also tend





to date younger women with subordinate jobs such as assistants rather than executive women. Online dating patterns suggest that men are more likely to initiate online exchanges. It also indicates that men are less picky than women and seek younger partners and tend to cast a wider net in the pool of women they choose. The stereotype for heterosexual women is that they seek well-educated men who are usually older and have high-paying jobs. Much of the research suggests that women are the pickier of the genders and that is linked to reproductive decision making.


Steve de Shazer was a psychotherapist who, along with his wife Insoo Kim Berg, developed solution-focused brief therapy.


Steve de Shazer (1940–2005) and his wife, Insoo Kim Berg (1934–2007), had both been trained in traditional psychoanalytic or Freudian therapy. They were frustrated because they found that it often didn’t work to help clients resolve their issues. In fact they felt it was harmful and led to an endless cycle of investigating the origins of the client’s issues. Because of these concerns, de Shazer and Kim Berg developed a new form of therapy called solution-focused.
   Solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) differs from other approaches to the treatment of psychological problems. The couple based SFBT on the concept that although causes of problems may be extremely


complex, their solutions do not necessarily need to be. Their therapeutic approach decided to focus on simple, doable solutions. Together de Shazer and Kim Berg founded the Brief Family Therapy Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the 1980s.
   SFBT, as a therapy model, does not put emphasis on the need to examine past problems. The approach focuses on the clients’ assessment of how their lives or experiences might be different if they didn’t exist at all. From this focus, the therapist builds approaches based on the clients’ own strengths and previous successes. SFBT is based on solution building rather than problem solving.
   Steve de Shazer and his wife were able to help clients build those solutions from insights and responses to what they called “the Miracle Question.” The miracle question was an intervention; it asked the client to think differently by responding to this question: “If you woke up tomorrow and a miracle occurred and the problem had completely disappeared, even though you didn’t know why, what small changes would tell you that it had been solved?” By asking their clients to describe how they would know the problem was resolved, and to evaluate how important the symptoms of improvement were, they could work with them to create change.


SFBT has been widely practiced and accepted in the therapeutic community. Its hallmark is to focus on creating solutions rather than rehashing problems. de Shazer was specifically in charge of researching the approach, which helped solidify SFBT not only as a foundational theory but also as a practice that could be taught to future practitioners. The small, positive changes that are based on the client’s perspective make it appealing to both professionals and their clients.
   The SFBT approach is criticized for some weaknesses such as not allowing for exploration of family history and patterns as well as the limited applicability to those experiencing chronic or severe disorders. Steve de Shazer and Kim Berg admitted that their approach would not be effective in about 20% of client cases. But it has been adapted for use in a variety of different environments. This includes clinical therapy





groups, schools, and hospital nursing staffs. Clinical and research results indicate that SFBT makes a positive difference and Steve de Shazer helped to validate and make this approach known among mental health professionals.





Dead Poets Society is a 1989 American-period film directed by Peter Weir and starring Robin Williams.


In the movie Dead Poets Society, Robin Williams (1951–2014) portrays an inspiring English teacher at an exclusive Vermont private boys’ academy in 1959. Dead Poets Society is perhaps best known for several iconic scenes in which Williams’s character, John Keating, dramatically and idealistically inspires his students. Central themes include individualism, freethinking, self-empowerment, and living significant, meaningful lives in light of issues of mortality and death.
   Set in 1959 the movie follows a class of students at the Welton Academy, a conservative prep school for boys. The story focuses on the impact a new and unconventional English teacher, John Keating, has on their lives. Keating, a former student at Welton, exposes the students to classic poetry in ways that are controversial and unorthodox for the time and setting. For instance, finding the mathematical formula to rate


poetry absurd, Keating has students rip out the introduction of the poetry textbook. In another scene, Keating has students stand on their desks in order to see life from a different perspective. In perhaps the most iconic scene, Keating gathers his students in front of a trophy case with pictures of alumni from years long past. Quoting from a poem by Robert Herrick “Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,” Keating tells the boys that the meaning of the poem is about “carpe diem,” which means “seize the day.” Keating tells his students “Because we are food for worms, lads. Cause believe it or not each and every one of us in this room is one day going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die. Therefore, seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary” 


Dead Poets Society portrays an inspiring English teacher (played by Robin Williams) at an exclusive Vermont private boys’ academy in 1959.The film has been used to illustrate concepts such as empowerment and individuality. 





   The students are both captivated and inspired by Keating’s ideals. Keating encourages the students to revive the “Dead Poets Society,” which meets secretly in a cave where they may reflect on how to “suck the marrow out of life,” pursue their dreams, and find their voice. The movie follows several of the students’ personal difficulties, challenges, and triumphs as they are changed by what they are leaning. For one student, Neil, his quest to find his own voice leads him to pursue acting and perform in a local play. This is in defiance of the plans his controlling authoritarian father has for him to become a medical doctor. Neil turns to Keating who encourages Neil to speak with his father to help him understand how he feels. Neil attempts to confront his father but is bullied and threatened with military school. Unable to reason with his father, Neil commits suicide.
   An investigation is launched, and Keating is accused of abusing his authority, inciting rebellion, and encouraging Neil to defy his father. After being betrayed by one of the students, Keating is made a scapegoat for Neil’s death and is fired. Entering the classroom one last time to retrieve his personal belongings, Keating is honored by the students standing on their desks in defiance of the headmaster.

Dead Poets Society was well received by the viewing public and maintains an 85% Rotten Tomatoes rating. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards and won for best Original Screenplay (Tom Schulman). It is recognized as one of Robin Williams’s best roles and performances.
   Dead Poets Society is used as a teaching film in a wide range of topics, including innovative teaching techniques, teacher/student relationships, mentoring, and lessons on empowerment and individualism. More recently, Dead Poets Society has been criticized for whether the main character, John Keating, is a positive or negative example for a teacher. Was he inspiring students to love poetry or to love him; to think for themselves or to think like him? The film also called into question the ethical responsibilities teachers have when instructing and mentoring impressionable students. How responsible was Keating in Neil’s death?


   Dead Poets Society is a highly popular and highly rated American film that explores issues of self-empowerment and meaning in life. The movie remains one of the most popular Robin Williams films and continues to be used in a wide range of educational settings.
Death, Denial of

The denial of death is when someone refuses to accept the concept of mortality for either himself or herself or someone else. Death is something that all living creatures experience at some point in their lives. It is an inevitable part of life that affects everyone. Many struggle to come to terms with the inevitable end of their own life or the loss of another.


Within the United States the discussion of death is often considered a taboo topic of conversation. There are many implications with dealing with grief and loss for the loss or pending loss of a loved one or demise of one’s self. Denial of death can occur for those who are terminally ill and seeing the end of their own life coming or for those who are anticipating the loss of a loved one or have already lost that person.
   The loss of a loved one can lead a person to experience shock, increase his or her desire to connect with others, or bring on sadness, regret, and other mixed emotions. It is important to note that there are different attitudes toward death among various cultures. These variations can play a role in how an individual deals with death.





   Humans have always contemplated the meaning of life and mortality. Regardless of how hard someone tries to ignore the awareness of the loss, symptoms will present through stressors, depressing thoughts, anxieties, or conflicts. Unfortunately, to be focused on the denial or fear of death can prevent people from living fully because so much energy is spent on the denial and avoidance of death. Freud argued that denial and fear of death is universal and a biological inheritance; however, therapists can help clients move past this fear or denial of death by working on acceptance.

In the time of grief and loss or when someone is struggling with the acceptance of the end of life, therapists may be called on to assist with the transition. Tragic or unexpected loss can be very difficult for a person to come to terms with, especially the loss of a loved one. In 2012 and 2013, U.S. citizens experienced several large-scale tragedies, the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting in Newtown, the Colorado movie theater shootings, devastating tornados in Oklahoma, the Boston Marathon bombing, and a plant explosion in Texas, all which cost many their lives. Agencies such as the Red Cross and other disaster reliefs are now including therapists and licensed practitioners as part of the first responders to meet the mental and emotional needs of those dealing with the loss of a loved one.



Defense mechanisms are unconscious psychological processes by which individuals unknowingly attempt to reduce anxiety or conflict. These can be either healthy or detrimental for the individual.


• Coping strategy is a conscious process employed by an individual to reduce anxiety or resolve a conflict or problem.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Psychoanalytic theory is a psychological theory that explains behaviors and perceptions as the result of unconscious, sexual, and biological instincts. This is the original theory of Sigmund Freud.
• Unconscious is an aspect of the mind which operates without awareness and over which one does not have active control. In contrast, the subconscious mind lies just below consciousness (awareness), and it is easily accessible if attention is paid to it.


Defense mechanisms are psychological processes by which an unconscious drive that is incompatible with the world or one’s sense of self is resolved. This process can also serve to protect an individual from the experience of fear, anxiety, and guilt. It can occur without the individual being initially aware that it is happening. Defense mechanisms are sometimes confused with coping strategies. The difference is that coping strategies are conscious efforts for dealing with conflicts. In contrast, defense mechanisms are unconscious efforts. Defense mechanisms date back to the work of Sigmund Freud, the originator of psychoanalytic theory. Originally called “ego defense mechanisms,” Freud





suggested that drives associated with the id (unconscious and primitive instincts) conflicted with the superego (moral part of self) representing societal rules and ideas of fairness. The reason it was called ego defense mechanism is that he believed the ego was the part of the self that resolved the conflict between the id and the superego. Although his model of ego is no longer used, his work served as the basis of contemporary defense mechanisms.
   Defense mechanisms are numerous and unique. Here are descriptions of some of the more common defense mechanism.

• Denial is the defense mechanism whereby the consequences, implication, or a disturbing event is blocked or denied, as if they have never happened. For example, an individual who is on the verge of bankruptcy may continue unsustainable spending when it is otherwise obvious that he or she should change spending habits. Individuals may completely deny an obvious fact, or they may also acknowledge that fact but deny the consequences. This is similar to repression except for in repression it is disturbing thoughts, not a physical reality that is denied.
• Displacement is the unconscious refocusing of negative feelings or impulses on to a different object, usually one that has less power to retaliate or threaten. For example, an employer, someone who is very difficult to retaliate against, may unfairly reprimand an individual. Instead of responding to the employer, the employee unknowing takes his or her aggression out on the family pet on returning home. This is similar to sublimation, except for in sublimation the transmutation of the impulse of thought is typically more acceptable.
• Intellectualization is characterized by unknowingly denying the emotional or meaningful content of thoughts or events. Instead, the individual considers the event in a removed or overly objective manner. That is to say that they deal with the event intellectually and not emotionally. For example, a parent may


be unable to knowingly accept the death of a child and subsequently may act robotic and unemotional toward spouse or others.
• Projection is a mechanism in which individuals extend some thought or quality about themselves on to another. For example, an individual may be unconsciously unwilling to accept that he or she has not achieved a high level of success and project this notion on to others. Subsequently, the individual may see or accuse others of being lazy or not achieving their potential.
• Rationalization is the most commonplace of defense mechanisms. This is characterized by explaining unacceptable events or thoughts with a logical argument while not acknowledging an apparent truth. For example, a student who receives a poor grade on a test may blame a professor for poor teaching when, in fact, the student did not study sufficiently.
• Reaction formation is the mechanism whereby an individual acts in a way contrary or opposite to his or her true sentiments. For example, if a man is attracted to a woman but unconsciously fears rejection, he may act cold and uninterested even if the woman acts as if she may be interested.
• Regression is characterized by a reaction to a disturbing event that is indicative of a less mature level of development. For example, an adult may experience significant financial hardship and revert to a childlike dependency on friends or parents.
• Repression is characterized by the unconscious blocking of disturbing thoughts from conscious awareness. An individual unknowingly represses difficult or unacceptable thoughts to such an extent that he or she is completely unaware of the disturbing thought having ever taken place. For example, an individual may have been exposed to abuse and acknowledge that it happened but be consciously unaware of any feelings about the event. This is similar to





denial, but different in with denial is the event itself that is blocked, not thoughts.
• Sublimation is a defense mechanism whereby an individual transfers the energy of a disturbing event or thought and expresses it in a more acceptable form. For example, someone who experienced a great deal of pain in childhood made unknowingly express his or her pain in art of exercise. This mechanism is similar to displacement except for in displacement the energy is transferred in to another object and is not necessarily dealt with in a more acceptable manner.
   Defense mechanisms are no longer listed in DSM-5; however, they were listed in the previous DSM-4 as an area to be studied further. Although they are not listed in the current DSM, they are nonetheless useful to a clinician in assessing clients and understanding their behavior.


Deinstitutionalization is the release of a person with mental or physical disabilities from a hospital, asylum, or other medical institution, usually with the intention of providing treatment, support, or rehabilitation through outpatient community resources.


Until the 1960s, American citizens who were diagnosed with severe mental illnesses, like schizophrenia, were institutionalized in government-run mental hospitals.


These people were deemed to require long-term or permanent professional care and institutions were often called asylums for the insane. Government policy beginning in the 1960s refocused the concept of care for those with severe mental illnesses. In the movement of deinstitutionalization, the government decided to transfer responsibility for mental health care from state government to local care centers that would be funded largely by the federal government.
   The deinstitutionalization of mental health care was made possible by several factors. The first was a change in the way society viewed the need and benefit of institutionalizing people with mental health issues. Mental health professionals began to feel that the large-scale institutionalization of people made them more dependent. Many believed that it accustomed patients to being passive recipients of care without encouraging them to change their circumstances or return to the outside world. Overall, people began to develop new attitudes toward those with mental health issues. People began seeing them no longer as patients for life but rather as people with treatable problems. Many believed that their issues could be resolved better within society rather than by removing them from society.
   The second factor that promoted this movement was the possibility of controlling thinking and behavior through drug treatment. With patients whose symptoms indicated they were doing well and whose medication was managed, it was deemed that they could once again participate in normal society. And, finally, the last factor that made deinstitutionalization possible was the shift of financial support of these facilities from states to federal budgets. This process began in the United States and soon spread to Europe.


Among most people deinstitutionalization was considered a success in terms of reducing the number of mental health patients in hospitals by 75% between 1955 and 1980. But there have been criticisms of the movement. One is that there is a high cost in terms of the poorer quality of patient care that may be available in community service settings. Some say that hospitalization programs provide better quality care. Another factor that many believe credible is that some patients





who would have been cared for in psychiatric institutions are now in prisons. This likely includes people who suffer from paranoid delusions or types of dementia. Those disorders may lead them to refuse help because they either believe that people are trying to hurt them or that they do not need the help. Many people experiencing psychosis break the law and end up in the prison system instead of in medical treatment.
   Inpatient hospital treatment does still exist in the United States and internationally. Most of these institutions, however, are privately owned and operated. Several privately run mental institutions provide services to patients who have broken the law but have been deemed mentally unfit and therefore instead of prison sentences they are ordered to seek inpatient hospital treatment. For these patients, their stays can range in time from a few months to decades.
   The shift from hospitalization to community-based treatment has resulted in some concerns. From some perspectives, community-based services are not always adequate to the task of meeting the complex needs of all patients. This could lead to a portion of those with mental health issues who are living homeless, jobless, or with limited social connections. Today, many families are forced to provide care that once would have been more widely available from state institutions. Deinstitutionalization by itself is not the simple solution to a difficult and long-term mental health-care problem. But it has given people with mental illness or disabilities the opportunity to have access to the community and gain as much independence as possible.



Delayed ejaculation is a mental disorder characterized by a male’s delay, difficulty, or inability to reach sexual orgasm. It is also referred to as male orgasmic disorder.


• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Orgasm is the peak of sexual excitation characterized by extremely pleasurable sensations.
• Sensate focus exercises are series of touching exercises designed to increase intimacy in a relationship. It is also called sensate focusing.
• Sexual dysfunctions disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant difficulty in the ability to respond sexually or to experience sexual pleasure. Disorders include female organismic disorder and delayed ejaculation.
• Sexual orgasm is orgasm attained through sexual intercourse instead of self-stimulation or oral stimulation.
• Systematic desensitization is a form of cognitive behavior therapy that gradually exposes individuals to their phobia, while remaining calm and relaxed.

Description and Diagnosis
Delayed ejaculation disorder is one of the DSM-5 sexual dysfunction disorders. It is characterized by delay, difficulty, or complete absence of sexual orgasm in males during otherwise normal sexual activity. Some with this disorder indicate that they avoid sex because





of it. There is no consensus on what constitutes a delay in ejaculation. For this reason, the male’s self-report is the basis for making the diagnosis. Delayed ejaculation is relatively rare, affecting less than 1% of men (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However, this disorder is more likely to occur after the age of 50. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, this diagnosis requires the following criteria to be met. First, the male must experience a delay or absence of sexual orgasm in 75% or more occasions of sexual activity with his partner. This delay must be present for at least six months and cannot be attributable to relationship stress, use of medications, another disorder, or a medical condition. In addition, it must cause the male considerable distress. Some individuals may experience this disorder for their entire lives or may develop symptoms following a period of otherwise normal sexual functioning. Also, symptoms may be present in certain situations or may always be present. The condition is further special


they are addressed in treatment. Specific medications are sometimes used in the treatment of this disorder.

Deliberate Practice

fied (diagnosed) as mild, moderate, or severe.	

   The cause of this disorder is not well understood. However, it is believed to be associated with relationship or partner issues, a history of sexual abuse, and stress. Cultural factors, religious issues, and social factors can also cause or complicate the disorder.


The goal of treatment is to restore normal sexual functioning. The first step in the treatment of this disorder is to identify and treat any physical cause or mental disorder. Like female orgasmic disorder, this dysfunction may have numerous cultural or social factors that must be considered. Therefore, treatment must be focused not only on the physical aspects of the disorder but also on the individual’s beliefs and personal history. Treatment most commonly includes psychotherapy. Typically, this involves cognitive behavior therapy and specifically sensate focus exercises and systematic desensitization. Involving the spouse or sexual partner may be necessary if relational issues are present or sensate focusing is used. It is not uncommon for the partner to believe that he is no longer attracted to her because of his inability to reach climax. This and other concerns can lead to additional complications unless

Deliberate practice is the intentional effort to achieve a level of expertise that is just beyond an individual’s level of proficiency. It is also known as purposeful practice.


• Deliberate practice is the intentional effort in striving to attain increased expertise just beyond an individual’s level of proficiency.
• Expertise is the special knowledge or skills in a particular subject or area learned from experience or training and a high level of proficiency in utilizing that knowledge or skills.
• Feedback is information about how well or badly an individual is performing a task and is intended to help the individual perform it better.
• Practice is the act of rehearsing or engaging in an activity repeatedly in order to improve performance.
• Self-reflection is the process of examining one’s own thoughts, feelings, and motivations in order to grow and change.




Expertise is a lifelong process of continued development extending over several years of professional practice. More specifically, it requires years of professional training, professional experience, and challenges to be confronted and overcome on the path to expertise. It also requires an awareness of one’s limitations, which motivates the individual to continue learning and developing throughout his or her career. Research suggests that it takes a minimum of 10 years for a high level of expertise to be achieved. This means 10 years of progressively increasing expertise, rather than 1 year of limited expertise that is repeated 10 times. The difference between the two is deliberate practice. Deliberate practice differs considerably from practice. The key difference is intentional, stretching beyond one’s current level of proficiency. Deliberate practice involves setting a stretch goal for performance, using specific interventions to master a specified task, seeking and using feedback, and engaging in self-reflection to optimize performance and increase expertise. In learning new skills, deliberate practice involves engaging in increasingly difficult elements of the skill. Setbacks and frustration are inevitable, and persistence and learning through failure, although unpleasant, are also necessary. Seeking ongoing feedback can greatly enhance deliberate practice. Then, it means using the feedback to alter the course or direction of treatment. Being open to feedback is part of deliberate practice.
Finally, deliberate practice is fostered by the use of
self-reflection.



In 1980, two researchers, Stuart Dreyfus (n.d.) and Hubert Dreyfus (1929), proposed that a learner passes through five distinct stages of developing expertise. These two brothers named the stages: novice, competence, proficiency, expertise, and mastery. Since then, the scientific study of expertise has expanded rapidly. Initially, this research focused on athletes, musicians, and chess players. Studies by psychologist K. Anders Ericsson (1948) found that at least 10,000 hours of deliberate practice spread over at least 10 years was necessary to develop expertise. Now, this research has


extended to physicians, psychotherapists, and elementary school students.


Delirium is a mental disorder characterized by rapid onset of extreme disorientation and confusion.


• Dementia is the deterioration or loss of mental processes, particularly memory and confusion.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Neurocognitive disorders are a group of disorders in DSM-5 that are characterized by a decline from a previous level of neurocognitive (mental) function.


Delirium is one of the neurocognitive disorders of the DSM-5. It is characterized by severe disorientation and confusion. Individuals who experience delirium





appear to be bewildered and are unable to comprehend attempts to communicate. While this condition is most often acute, it can be chronic for some, particularly the elderly. Since the symptoms of delirium and dementia can be similar, it is essential that an accurate diagnosis be made by a trained physician or clinician.
   This disorder is relatively rare in the population as a whole, affecting between 1% and 2%. However, over the course of an individual’s lifetime it is not unlikely that the individual may experience delirium at some point. With increasing age, the chances of experiencing delirium increase significantly, especially in hospital and nursing facilities. In fact, delirium occurs in 15%–53% of individuals after a surgery and approximately 80% of those in intensive care. In addition, 83% of individuals experience delirium as they are dying (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they experience difmedication or substance. Treatment then focuses on calming the brain and reducing disorientation using reorientation techniques. These include memory cues such as a calendar and clocks, and making the environment stable, quiet, and well-lighted. In many cases, the condition will resolve without the use of drugs or treatment.
difficulty in focusing their attention and awareness, and	
are disoriented. These symptoms must have developed over a short time period and tend to fluctuate in severity. Also, the symptoms must be accompanied by some limitation in memory, coordination, or ability to communicate. Finally, there must be evidence that the disturbance has been caused by a substance, medication, or a medical condition or exposure to a toxic substance (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   Unlike most mental disorders, the cause of delirium is well understood. It usually results from medical conditions that deprive the brain of oxygen or induce chemical imbalances. Most commonly these are dehydration or infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and abdominal infections. Other causes include alcohol or drug intoxication or withdrawal, exposure to a poison or toxic substance, and surgery. Some medications, like allergy medications, or combinations of medications can trigger delirium.


The primary focus of treatment is to address the underlying cause or causes. Usually this means treating an infection, giving oxygen, or stopping the use of the

Delusional disorder is a mental disorder characterized by delusions. Previously this disorder was referred to as paranoia or paranoid disorder.

Definitions
• Antipsychotics are prescription medications used to treat psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic depression.
• Delusions are fixed false beliefs that persist despite contrary evidence. The can be bizarre or non-bizarre (could occur in real life, such as being followed or conspired against).
• Hallucinations are false or distorted sensory perceptions that appear to be real perceptions that are generated by the mind rather than by an external stimuli.
• Psychoeducation is a psychological treatment method that provides individuals with knowledge about the condition as well as advice and skills for reducing their symptoms and improving their functioning.





• Psychosis (psychotic disorder) is a mental disorder characterized by a loss of touch with reality and psychotic features.
• Psychotic features are characteristics of psychotic disorders: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and speech, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and negative symptoms, for example, lack of initiative and diminished emotional expression.
• Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by psychotic features. These disorders include schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder, and delusional disorder.


Delusional disorder is one of the schizophrenic spectrum and other psychotic disorders. It is characterized by non-bizarre delusions, which is the signature feature of this disorder. This diagnosis requires the presence of persistent, non-bizarre delusions, without the other psychotic features characteristic of other schizophrenia disorders. In fact, most with the disorder can be sociable and appear quite normal as long as their delusions are not triggered in conversation. But, when triggered, these individuals are likely to express their strange beliefs. Because their psychosis is limited and contained, these individuals are able to function reasonably well in other areas of their life. That means that professionals like physicians, lawyers, and teachers who are delusional can otherwise function in their jobs and personal lives. However, there are some who become so preoccupied with their delusion that their lives become disrupted.
   Several types of delusional disorders can be specified, each of which reflects a dominant delusional theme. These include the Erotomanic Type, with the theme that someone of a higher status is in love with the individual. In the Grandiose Type, the theme involves inflated power or a special relationship to a deity or famous individual. In the Jealous Type, the theme involves the unfaithful of the individual’s sexual


partner. In the Persecutory Type, the theme involves being abused or treated malevolently. In the Somatic Type, the theme involves having a physical defect or medical condition. Delusional disorder is a rare disorder and is found in approximately 0.2% of adults. The jealous type is more common in females, while the persecutory type is more common in males (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit one or more delusions. Such delusions are manifest for at least one month. In addition, there are no positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations. If hallucinations are present, they are related to the theme of the delusions. Functioning at work or in relationships is not significantly impaired. Nor is the individual’s behavior considered odd, bizarre, or eccentric. If a major depressive episode or a manic episode has occurred concurrently, these episodes have been relatively brief. The symptoms of this disorder must develop during or within one month of intoxication by or withdrawal from the substance. Finally, the disorder cannot be caused by a substance, a medical condition, or another mental disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is not well understood. However, genetic, biochemical, and environmental factors may play a significant role in its development. There is a strong family link with this disorder and both schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorders, suggesting a genetic basis (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Biochemically, those with this disorder may have an imbalance in neurotransmitters (brain chemicals) that accounts for their symptoms. Also, environmental factors such as social isolation, drug abuse, excessive stress, and recent immigration may increase the risk of developing this disorder.


 delusional beliefs are resistant to compelling contrary evidence and rational disputation. Individuals with this disorder are convinced that their delusional beliefs are correct and that there is no need to change them. Accordingly, treatment of this disorder





can be extraordinarily difficult. The longer the symptoms have been present, the more refractory they are to simple treatments such as psychoeducation, psychotherapy, or medication. When those with this disorder agree to psychotherapy, it should be initiated in such a way that its benefits outweigh their reluctance to discuss their beliefs. Accordingly, early therapy sessions should emphasize developing a trusting relationship with a neutral and accepting therapist. Cognitive behavior therapy can be useful in changing delusional behavior. Antipsychotic medication can be also effective with this disorder. Such medication can take the “edge” off delusions and facilitate psychotherapy. However, those with this disorder are often resistant to taking medication.


Delusions 

disorder was referred to as paranoia or paranoid disorder.
• Hallucinations are false or distorted sensory perceptions that appear to be real perceptions that are generated by the mind rather than by an external stimuli.
• Paranoia is an unfounded or exaggerated distrust or suspiciousness of others.
• Psychosis (psychotic disorder) is a mental disorder characterized by a loss of touch with reality and psychotic features.
• Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that affects behavior, thinking, and emotion which make distinguishing between real and unreal experiences difficult. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, thought and communication disturbances, and withdrawal from others.

Delusions are unshakeable false beliefs. They are irrational, defy normal reasoning, and remain firm even in the face of overwhelming proof to the contrary. These beliefs are not accepted by others in the individual’s culture or subculture (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). They are psychotic symptoms that are often accompanied by hallucinations or paranoia which act to strengthen the delusions. Delusions must be distinguished from overvalued or unreasonable ideas. With such ideas individuals usually have some doubt about the validity of their ideas. In contrast, delusional individuals are absolutely convinced that their
delusions are valid.

Delusions are fixed, false beliefs that persist despite contrary evidence.

• Antipsychotic medications are prescription medications used to treat psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and delusional disorder.
• Delusional disorder is a mental disorder characterized by delusions. Previously this
   
Delusions are categorized as either bizarre or non-bizarre. Bizarre delusions are false beliefs that could never occur in real life, such as the belief that president is an alien. Non-bizarre delusions are false beliefs that could occur in real life, such as being followed or conspired against. Delusions can be symptoms of many physical and mental disorders, as well as reactions to some medications. They are most common in schizophrenia and delusional disorder. Delusional disorder is a rare disorder and is found in approximately 0.2% of adults. Jealous delusions are more





common in females, while persecutory delusions are more common in males (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Other common disorders that may involve delusions include depression, bipolar disorder, and some types of alcohol and drug abuse. Many with Alzheimer’s disease eventually develop delusions.
   There are several types of delusions. The most common are described here.
Persecutory delusions. Individuals with this delusion falsely believe that they are being followed, cheated, drugged, conspired against, spied on, attacked, or obstructed in their pursuit of a goal. This type of delusion can be so broad and complex that it can appear to explain everything that happens to an individual. This is the most common type of delusions.
Jealous delusions. Individuals with this delusion
falsely believe that their romantic partner is having an affair. Those with this belief may try to restrict their partner’s activities or gather “evidence” and confront the partner about the nonexistent affair. This type of delusion is most likely to be associated with violent behavior. It is the second most common type of delusions. Erotomanic delusions. Individuals with this delusion falsely believe that a famous individual or someone of higher status is in love with them. Usually, they attempt to contact the other through phone calls, letters, or gifts. Sometimes this delusion leads to stalking or violence against that individual or a perceived
romantic rival.
  Grandiose delusions. Individuals with this delusion falsely believe that they have special talents, powers, or abilities. They may even believe that they are famous or that they have a special mission in life. For example, they may believe they are a rock star or sent by God to save the world. More often, they believe that they have made a significant contribution for which they have not gotten sufficient recognition.
  Somatic delusions. Individuals with this delusion falsely believe that their body is somehow diseased, deformed, or infested. For example, they may believe that their body is infested with parasites. Often this delusion leads to excessive and irrational concerns about their body so that they continually seek medical treatment for their imagined condition.
Delusion of reference. Individuals with this delusion falsely believe that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in their environment have personal meaning for them. They may believe that they are receiving special messages from a newspaper story or a television announcement. Often, the meaning assigned to such messages is negative.
   While delusions of reference may be bizarre, most persecutory, somatic, erotomanic, grandiose, and jealous delusions are considered non-bizarre.
   While delusions are usually caused by an underlying medical condition, other mental disorders, or drug reaction, the exact cause is unknown. Genetics, neurotransmitter (brain chemicals) abnormalities, and psychological factors may also play a role. Delusions can be caused by drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine, and phencyclidine. Delusions can occur both during use and withdrawal from drugs or alcohol. Some prescription drugs, including stimulants, steroids, and medications for Parkinson’s disease, can cause delusions.


Individuals with delusions often resist diagnosis and treatment. Because of their firm convictions in their delusions, they believe that there is nothing about them that needs to change. Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the delusions. Antipsychotic medications and psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavior therapy, are commonly used. The prognosis for delusions depends on the underlying cause. Those caused by schizophrenia usually disappear within a few weeks of starting antipsychotic medication. With appropriate treatment, even those with diagnoses of delusional disorder can experience some relief of symptoms.


Dementia is the deterioration or loss of mental processes, particularly memory.


• Alzheimer’s disease is a medical and mental disorder that causes dementia, particularly late in life. It is also referred to as Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease.
• DSM-5 is the abbreviation for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders.
• Neurocognitive disorders are a group of disorders in DSM-5 that are characterized by a decline from a previous level of neurocognitive (mental) function.



Dementia is a group of symptoms including loss of memory, judgment, language, and other cognitive (mental) function caused by the death of neurons (nerve cells) in the brain. It may also include changes in behavior, personality, and motor functions. There is commonly a loss of memory and the skills. The changes can be severe enough to seriously disrupt the individual’s ability to carry out activities of daily living. These changes can be due to medical conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease or a stroke (vascular dementia) or because of repeated blows to the head (in football players and boxers). Of the various types of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease causes the most complications.
   Dementia involves more than memory loss. It also involves decline in intellectual function, including difficulties with language, simple calculations, planning and judgment, and abstract reasoning. While dementia


is not caused by aging, it is quite common in older individuals. It results from infections, brain diseases, tumors, and injuries to or biochemical changes within the brain. It should be noted that the term “dementia” has been replaced by “neurocognitive disorder” in DSM-5. The reason is that while dementia is most associated with cognitive impairment in the elderly, the term “neurocognitive disorder” is widely used and often preferred for conditions affecting younger individuals, such as impairment due to traumatic brain injury or HIV infection (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   There are several types of dementia. Following are brief descriptions of the more common types.
Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease is the
sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death for persons 65 years of age and older. Between 60% and 90% and more of dementias are estimated to be of this type. Before the age of 70, about 10% of adults are diagnosed with the disorder. That figure rises to at least 25% after ago 70. Women are more likely than are men to develop this disease, in part because they tend to live longer (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Vascular dementia. This type is also called
multi-infarct dementia because it involves changes in blood vessels in the brain. It is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. Within three months following a stroke, between 20% and 30% of individuals are diagnosed with this type. It is more common in men than in women (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Risk factors for it include high blood pressure, diabetes, a history of smoking, and heart disease.
Dementia with Lewy bodies. Dementia with Lewy
bodies is probably the next most common form of dementia after vascular dementia. Lewy bodies are chemical substances in damaged nerve cells in the brain that cause or complicate dementia. Because the relationship between Lewy bodies in various types of dementia is not well understood, exact statistics for this type are unclear. Yet it is estimated that up to 30.5% of all dementias are of this type (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Other dementias. There are several other less
common types of dementia. These include frontal lobe dementia, Pick’s disease, Huntington disease,





Parkinson’s disease, HIV infection, and head trauma. Repeated head trauma in those playing contact sports in high school and college is now considered a risk factor for developing dementia in later life. These other dementias may account for about 10% of all dementias.


The primary goals of treating dementias are to preserve functioning and independence, and maintain quality of life, as much as possible. Specific treatment of dementia is based on its type and the particular case. In some types, cognitive function can be improved but not corrected. In some cases, dementia respond better to treatment than others. For example, treating high blood pressure in someone with the vascular dementia type can lead to considerable improvement in memory and cognitive functioning. In contrast, those in the advanced-stage Alzheimer’s type may experience little or no improvement. However, in all cases, appropriate care and support is always helpful and should be extended. Medication and cognitive behavior therapy interventions are additional interventions.
   Medications that target the symptoms of dementia include Cognex, Aricept, Exelon, Reminyl, and Namenda. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) interventions may be used to reduce the frequency or severity of problem behaviors such as aggression or socially inappropriate behavior. CBT is particularly useful in identifying and modifying the situations that trigger problem behaviors, which can be effective.






Depakote is a prescribed medication for the treatment and prevention of seizures. Its generic name is divalproex sodium.

• Absence seizures are ones characterized by abrupt, short-term lack of conscious activity along with behaviors such as eye rolls, blank stares, and lip movements. It is also referred to as petit mal seizures.
• Antiseizure medications are a group of prescription drugs used to treat epilepsy as well as burning, stabbing, and shooting pain. It is also called anticonvulsant medications.
• Epilepsy is a medical condition involving episodes of irregular electrical discharge within the brain that causes impairment or loss of consciousness, followed by convulsions.
• Seizure is a sudden convulsion or uncontrolled discharge of nerve cells that may spread to other cells throughout the brain.
• Tonic-clonic seizures are ones that involve the entire body and are accompanied by muscle contractions, rigidity, and unconsciousness. It is also referred to as grand mal or generalized seizures.
• Trigeminal neuralgia is a disorder of the trigeminal nerve which causes severe facial pain.


Depakote is one of the antiseizure medications. It is effective in the treatment of epilepsy, particularly in preventing simple and complex absence seizures and





tonic-clonic seizures. Depakote is also used to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder in adults, to prevent migraines in adults, and to reduce the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. It is effective in the treatment of epilepsy and in preventing absence seizures, mixed, and tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures. Depakote is also used to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder in adults, to prevent migraines in adults, and to reduce the pain of trigeminal neuralgia.
   Its generic names are divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, and valproic acid. Depakote contains the same medication as Depakene except that it is coated to reduce some of its gastrointestinal side effects. Depakote is believed to work by increasing the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. That means that as GABA levels increase in the brain neurons or nerve cells, these cells are less likely to become activated or fire. The results are that seizure activity decreases, manic behavior is curbed, and the frequency of migraine headache is decreased.



Because Depakote can interfere with blood clotting, blood tests should be done before starting the medication and at intervals throughout its use. Depakote use can increase the risk of birth defects when taken during pregnancy. Women who take Depakote should not breast-feed, since it can pass into the breast milk. Depakote causes drowsiness and impairs alertness in some individuals, so care must be taken in driving and using machinery until they determine how the drug affects them. The sedative effects are increased in the presence of alcohol, so it should be avoided when taking Depakote.
   Common side effects of Depakote are mild stomach cramps, change in menstrual cycle, diarrhea, loss of hair, indigestion, change in appetite, nausea and vomiting, and trembling in the hands and arms. Such side effects tend to resolve with time. Another common side effect is weight gain. Those taking Depakote should be on a balanced, low-fat diet coupled with an increase in physical activity to counter this side effect.






Dependent personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a pattern of submissiveness, a lack of self-confidence, and an excessive need to be taken care of by others.


• Assertiveness training is a behavior change method for increasing self-esteem and self-expression in intimidating interpersonal situations.
• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behavior, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.


The dependent personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of dependent and submissive behaviors. Individuals with this disorder are excessively passive, insecure, and





isolated, and become overly dependent on others. Because of their fear of rejection and abandonment, they go to great lengths to secure and maintain relationships. Individuals with this disorder see themselves as inadequate and helpless. As a result they relinquish personal responsibility and put their fate in the hands of others to protect and take care of them. While at first acceptable, this dependent behavior can become controlling and may even appear hostile. This disorder is more common in females (2:1 females to males). In females, the dependent style often takes the form of submissiveness. In males, the dependent style is more likely to be autocratic, so that the husband and boss depends on his wife and secretary to perform basic tasks which he himself cannot accomplish. Whatever the case, this disorder can lead to anxiety and depression when the dependent relationship is threatened.
   The clinical presentation of the dependent personality disorder is characterized by the following: behavioral style, interpersonal style, thinking style, and feeling style. Individuals’ behavioral and interpersonal styles are characterized by docility, passivity, and non-assertiveness. In interpersonal relations, they tend to be pleasing, self-sacrificing, clinging, and constantly requiring others’ reassurance. Their reliance on others leads to a subtle demand that others assume responsibility for major areas of their lives. Their thinking style of dependent personalities is characterized by suggestibility. Also, they tend to minimize difficulties, and because of their naiveté are easily persuadable and easily taken advantage of. Their feeling style is characterized by insecurity and anxiousness. Because they lack self-confidence, they may experience considerable discomfort at being alone. They may be preoccupied with the fear of abandonment and disapproval of others. Their mood tends to be one of anxiety or fearfulness.
The cause of this disorder is not well understood.
However, these individuals tend to have characteristic view of themselves, the world, and others, and a basic life strategy. They view themselves as inadequate and self-effacing. They tend to view the world and others as caretakers since they do not believe they can care for themselves. Accordingly, their basic life strategy and pattern is to cling and rely on others to care for them. In turn, they respond by being pleasing and willing to do whatever others want.


   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a pervasive need to be cared for and cling to others because of their fear of separation. They constantly seek the advice and reassurance of others when making decisions. More than anything, they want others to take responsibility for most major areas of their lives. Not surprisingly, they seldom express disagreement with others for fear they will lose their support and approval. Because they lack confidence in their own judgment and ability, they have difficulty starting projects and doing things on their own. These individuals will even engage in actions that are difficult and unpleasant in order to receive support and caring from others. Because of unrealistic fears of being unable to take care of themselves, they feel helpless or uncomfortable when faced with being alone. When a close relationship is about to end, they immediately seek out another caring and supportive relationship. Finally, they become preoccupied with fears of being left to take care of themselves (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).



The clinical treatment of this disorder usually involves psychotherapy. In general, the long-range goal of psychotherapy with a dependent personality is to increase the individual’s sense of independence and ability to function interdependently. At other times, the therapist may need to settle for a more modest goal, that is, helping the individual become a “healthier” dependent personality. Treatment strategies typically include challenging the individual’s limiting beliefs about personal inadequacy and learning ways in which to increase assertiveness in communicating with others. Assertiveness training is commonly used to achieve this. A variety of methods can be used to increase self-reliance. Among these are providing these individuals with directives and opportunities for making decisions, being alone, and taking responsibility for their own well-being.








Depersonalization/derealization disorder is a mental disorder characterized by symptoms of depersonalization, derealization, or both.


• Antianxiety medications are prescribed drugs that relieve anxiety symptoms. They are also called anxiolytics or tranquilizers.
• Antidepressants are prescription medications used to treat depression and depressive symptoms.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Depersonalization is a mental state of detachment or a sense of being “outside” oneself or body and observing one’s actions or thoughts.
• Derealization is a mental state characterized by a sense that one is out of touch with one’s surroundings, as if in a dream.
• Dissociative disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a disturbance of self, memory, awareness, or consciousness and which cause impaired functioning.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by


professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Psychotic disorder is a severe mental condition in which an individual loses touch with reality. Symptoms can include hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), delusions (fixed false beliefs that persist despite contrary evidence), and disordered thinking.



Depersonalization/derealization disorder is one of the dissociative disorders in DSM-5. It is characterized by the experience of being out of touch with oneself and/ or one’s immediate surroundings. The symptom of depersonalization relates to an individual’s perceptions about his or her physical body or mind, while derealization relates to an individual’s surroundings. Individuals presenting with this disorder may express that they feel as if they are in a dream, that things around them seem as if they are artificial, that they are having an out-of-body experience, or that they feel as if they are an automated robot. It is also likely that an individual may have difficulty describing his or her symptoms. This disorder was previously called “depersonalization disorder” but was changed to include the symptom of derealization as it is now considered to result from the same cause.
   Many individuals will experience short-term (from hours to several days) depersonalization or derealization symptoms sometime during their lifetime. Most common is daydreaming. However, longer-term manifestation that is diagnosable as this disorder is rare, affecting less than 2% of the population. This disorder occurs equally as often in both males and females. In most cases, the cause of this disorder is not known. However, childhood trauma, severe stress, and the ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs are known to cause this disorder. Typically, this disorder manifests around age 16 and almost always prior to age 25 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).





   To be diagnosed with this disorder, individuals must experience persistent or recurrent depersonalization and/or derealization. Individuals must still be able to think logically about what is in fact reality and what is only a thought or perception; this is called reality testing. If they cannot discern what is real and what is not, then clinicians must consider the psychotic disorders for diagnosis. In addition, if an individual is over age 40, medical conditions must be carefully ruled out as it is extremely rare for such late onset. For some who experience this disorder, it may have a sudden onset with continuous symptoms while others may have only intermittent episodes (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The exact cause of this disorder is not well understood. Nevertheless, it is believed to be linked to an imbalance of neurotransmitters (brain chemicals) that make a brain vulnerable to fear and severe stress. Other likely causes include experiencing abuse or observing violence toward a family member. It might also include severe stress or trauma associated with a car accident.


Treatment for depersonalization/derealization disorder may include both medications and psychotherapy. Commonly used medications include both antianxiety medication and antidepressants. Various psychotherapy approaches can be used. The most is cognitive behavior therapy.






Deplin is a prescription remedy that is usually taken with a prescription antidepressant medication to more effectively treat symptoms of depression. Its generic name is methyl folate.


• Antidepressant medications are prescription drugs that are primarily used to treat depression and depressive disorders. They are known as antidepressants.
• Blood–brain barrier is a specialized layer of cells around the blood vessels of the brain controlling which substances can pass from the circulatory system into the brain.
• Folate is a B vitamin which is needed to maintain cell growth and brain function. Deficiencies are associated with depression and result from diet, illness, aging, and some medications. The synthetic form of it is called folic acid.
• Genetic variations (single nucleotide polymorphisms) can predict an individual’s response to certain drugs, susceptibility to environmental factors such as toxins, and risk of developing particular diseases.
• Medical food is a therapeutic substance administered under the supervision of a physician. It is intended for the specific dietary management of a medical condition, such as depression.
• Methyl folate is the active form of folate which helps in producing mood-regulating neurotransmitters. The risk of depression is higher in those with genetic variations that reduce the ability to make L-methyl folate.
• Personalized medicine is medical practice that uses information about an individual’s





unique genetic makeup and environment to customize medical care to the individual’s unique needs.


Deplin is a prescribed medical food (remedy) containing methyl folate, the active form of folate, which is a B vitamin. Unlike folic acid, methyl folate crosses the blood–brain barrier where it helps balance the neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that affect mood (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine). Deplin provides the necessary nutritional support so the brain can produce sufficient levels of the needed neurotransmitters to balance mood. In this novel form of treatment, Deplin is used in addition to (augmentation) an antidepressant. The way in which Deplin works differs from that of antidepressants. For example, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant like Paxil works by slowing the “reuptake” of serotonin, making it available longer to the brain. But this SSRI may not work for long, or at all, if the brain is not producing sufficient quantities of serotonin (or other neurotransmitters) in the first place. This may explain why only 30% of those prescribed their first antidepressant get well (achieve remission) and why up to 50% of all those taking antidepressants never reach remission of their depression. Research shows that those with low levels of methyl folate are six times as likely to fail to respond to antidepressants only as those with normal levels. The reason for this appears to be genetic variations that reduce the individual’s ability to make methyl folate. Taking folic acid does not have the same effect since only methyl folate crosses the blood–brain barrier. Initial research showed that an SSRI antidepressant augmented with Deplin more than doubled the response rates of an SSRI antidepressant augmented by a placebo (14.6% vs. 32.3%). Deplin reflects a shift that is beginning to occur in the practice of medicine. Customizing medication and other medical and preventive care is the basis for what is being called “personalized medicine.”

The rate of side effects reported by those who were given Deplin with an antidepressant at the beginning


of therapy was similar to the rate of side effects reported by those who took only an antidepressant. But only a half of those who were on Deplin and an antidepressant stopped their therapy due to side effects. This means that those on Deplin and an antidepressant responded to the “main effects” (their depression improved) while “side effects” were not present or less bothersome. In terms of side effects, Deplin was not linked to weight gain, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), or sexual dysfunction. Since Deplin is relatively new, research on it is currently limited.


Depression is an emotional state characterized by feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, guilt, or reduced ability to enjoy life. It is not considered a mental disorder unless it significantly disrupts the individual’s daily functioning.


• Bipolar disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by changes in mood and in energy (e.g., being highly irritable and impulsive while not needing sleep). These include bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder.





• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Depressive disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a sad or irritable mood and cognitive and physical changes that significantly disrupt the individual’s daily functioning. It includes major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
• Premenstrual syndrome is a medical condition in which cramps, breast tenderness, bloating, irritability, and depression occur prior to a woman’s menstrual period and subside after it.
• SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. They are a class of antidepressant medications that work by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin in nerve cells and raising its level in the brain resulting in symptom reduction.



“Depression” is the general name for a group of mental conditions known as depressive disorders. Most individuals experience depressive symptoms (feeling down or blue) at some point in their lives. When these symptoms are mild and short lived, they are considered a normal emotional reaction. However, when they are more severe and significantly affect daily functioning, they are considered a depressive disorder. Depressive disorders are mental conditions that require medical and psychological treatment.
   Depressive disorders are widespread and are a leading cause of disability in the world. Commonly recognized symptoms of the various types of depressive disorders are recurring feelings of sadness and guilt, sleep problems, changes in appetite, decreased energy, irritability, poor concentration, hopelessness, and thoughts of death or suicide. If only these “down” symptoms are experienced, the diagnosis is likely to be a (unipolar) depressive disorder. But if the depressed


periods alternate with extreme “up” periods, the individual may have a bipolar disorder.
   Depression is one of the leading causes of disability in the United States. According to National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 9.5% of adult Americans have some type of depressive disorder. One out of every four college students has some type of diagnosable mental illness. Even elementary school students have been diagnosed with depressive symptoms. Women experience depression at a rate of nearly twice that of men. Internationally, depression is estimated to become the second most common health problem in the world by 2020.
   The following depressive disorders are briefly described here. They are major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.


Major depressive disorder is also called major depression. In this disorder individuals experience episodes of sad mood or anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure) that last longer than two weeks. These episodes are marked with five or more symptoms, and they significantly disrupt their everyday function (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Individuals may also have thoughts of self-harm. This disorder is quite different from bereavement or a grief reaction associated with the death of a loved one. Some with this disorder may experience a single episode of severe depression in their lifetimes. For many others, recurrent episodes of such depression will occur throughout their lives.


Persistent depressive disorder was previously called dysthymic disorder. It is a new diagnosis in DSM-5 that consolidates major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years and other depressive symptoms. While the symptoms tend to be less severe than those in major depressive disorder, they cause significant disruptions in the individual





daily functioning. For many individuals, this disorder is a lifelong condition.

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder
Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is a diagnosis for children between the ages of 6 and 18 years. It is characterized by severe and persistent irritability resulting in temper tantrums and persistent anger or irritability between the tantrums. Both interfere with children’s ability to function at home, in school, or with their friends. Prior to DSM-5, many with this symptom pattern were likely to be labeled as “bipolar children.” Some of these children were diagnosed with bipolar disorder even though they seldom met all the symptoms and criteria. In fact, few will go on to develop bipolar disorder as adults. Rather, children with chronic irritability are more likely to develop depressive and/or anxiety disorders when they become adults (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).


Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome in which mood swings, depression, irritability, or anxiety significantly disrupts everyday functioning. Both premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder have physical and emotional symptoms. However, premenstrual dysphoric disorder causes extreme mood shifts that can disrupt the individual’s work and relationships. In both the syndrome and disorder, symptoms typically begin 7 to 10 days before the menstrual period starts and continue for the first few days of the period. Both can cause fatigue, bloating, breast tenderness, and changes in sleep and eating patterns. However, in the disorder at least one of the following emotional or behavioral symptoms stands out: extreme moodiness, marked irritability or anger, overwhelming sadness or hopelessness, or extreme anxiety or tension.
   The cause of these depressive disorders is not clearly understood. Yet they appear to have some genetic, biochemical, and environmental factors that cause or worsen these disorders. Genetic imbalances in neurotransmitters (brain chemicals) and hormones are likely causes. There are also various environmental factors that are involved. These include stressful


environments, certain medical conditions, and precipitating events such as the loss of a job or relationship. Alcohol and drug use and prescribed medications that alter brain chemistry can also be causes.


Treatment of these depressive disorders depends on the type of disorder and the specific case. Those with mild forms of a disorder may respond fully to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or other form of psychotherapy and not require medication. Others with moderate or severe forms of a disorder may require the combination of antidepressant medication like the SSRIs and therapy. Medication can provide relatively rapid relief from the symptoms of depression. CBT can help by changing the individual’s patterns of thinking or behaving that resulted in the depressive episode.






Depression in youth can significantly interfere with a child’s or teen’s mood and behavior often resulting in sadness, loneliness, and inactivity.

• Depression is an emotional state characterized by feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, guilt, or reduced ability to enjoy life. It is not considered a mental disorder unless it significantly disrupts one’s daily functioning.
Depression in children and adolescents is classified as an internalizing disorder. This means that it takes place largely within the child’s mind and doesn’t produce external behaviors such as hyperactivity or aggression. Clinical depression in youth can be differentiated from the more normal phases of sadness and anxiety associated with development, especially in the teenage years. Unfortunately, it is often not recognized because it can be difficult to identify. If depression in children and teens is left untreated, it can lead to self-destructive behaviors, such as cutting or even suicide.
   It has been estimated that as many as 2%–8% of youth may experience major depressive disorder. Researchers tend to think that the numbers for teens are higher than that. Some research says as many as 20% of adolescents may experience major depression at some point before the end of high school.


The causes of depression in children and teens are varied. Studies have indicated that everything from genetics to environmental factors can play a role. It is generally agreed that there is a strong link between the presence of stressors and the development of depression. Sadly, there can be a cycle of stressful events that happen to a child who experiences depression. Life stressors lead to depression and depression leads to even more feelings of stress. But some children handle


their experiences of stress more easily, while others suffer from depression.
   Without dismissing biological causes and genetics, it is clear that depression is often a multigenerational reaction to stressors. In other words, in some instances it is a learned behavior or a set of problematic reactions to stimuli in the lives of the depressed person. Problematic personal judgments in combination with negative social interactions can set the framework for depression in youth.
   The symptoms of depression in youth are similar to those of depression in general. They include emotional issues such as intense feelings of sadness, low expression of emotion, and irritability. Other symptoms to look for as signs of depression are lack of sleep, unhealthy eating habits, and risky or injurious behaviors. Symptom includes talking about or acting on suicidal thoughts. In addition to these symptoms, others include a child having low self-esteem, focusing on negative or bad things, and distancing from friends and others.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of depression in young people depends on the observations of parents and teachers. However, beginning in the late 1970s several self-reporting tools were developed. These tests refined the ability to detect depression based on a child’s own reporting of his or her symptoms. The success of these tools, examples of which are the Children’s Depression Inventory and the Kids Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia in School-Age Children, highlights the importance of educating children and teens on how to recognize the symptoms and seek help for depression.
   With early treatment for depression in youth, the prognosis is positive. This is usually most successful with counseling that involves the family and, in some cases, medication to help alleviate symptoms in children with depression. The longer treatment is delayed, the more challenging it will be to provide effective interventions.


Cognitive behavior therapy is a preferred method of treatment for depression in youth. It contains a range





of activities and approaches, including related therapies like rational-emotive therapy, attribution retraining, learned optimism, and journal writing. Some of these are ways of beginning to reframe the emotional issues for children and teens. This helps them to learn new ways of understanding and counteract their depressive thoughts and behaviors. Getting involved in positive and fun activities, especially ones that involve physical movement, is another effective method for combatting depression.
   In some cases, psychiatric drugs are used for children and teens who suffer from depression. Medication to help treat depression in youth can be used either as a temporary measure or on a long-term basis. The combination of psychotherapy and medication is a common approach to treatment.


Depressive personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a persistent and lifelong pattern of pessimism, unhappiness, low self-esteem, and guilt. It is also known as melancholic personality disorder.


• Antidepressants are prescribed medications that are primarily used to treat depression and



• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Depression is a sad mood or emotional state that is characterized by feelings of low self-worth or guilt and a reduced ability to enjoy life. Unless it greatly disrupts an individual’s daily functioning, it is not considered a mental disorder.
• Depressive disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a sad or irritable mood and cognitive and physical changes that significantly disrupt an individual’s daily functioning. These disorders include major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder.
• Hypomanic personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by an enduring pattern of hypomania that shapes cognition, attitudes, and identity. This pattern predictably shapes such individuals’ behavior and relationships with others.
• Persistent depressive disorder is a depressive disorder characterized by a chronic, depressed mood lasting for more than two years. It was previously called dysthymic disorder.
• Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behavior, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.

Depressive personality disorder is a persistent and pervasive pattern of pessimism, unhappiness, low self-esteem, and guilt that begins in early adulthood and occurs in a variety of contexts. Depressive personality disorder occurs before, during, and after other depressive disorders, making it a distinct diagnosis. Individuals with this disorder are marked by





characteristic pessimism. They appear depressed, dejected, and joyless which can be disheartening to others. While they can suffer from mood swings, they are more often unhappy and melancholic. They are also overly critical and judgmental of others and constantly feel guilty and worthless.
   Depressive personality disorder is listed among the personality disorders in the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual. It is described as the converse or polar opposite of the hypomanic personality disorder. Interestingly, depressive personality disorder was not listed with the other personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Nevertheless, it was listed in its Appendix B as a diagnosis worthy of further study, along with research criteria.
   The DSM-IV-TR provides the following research criteria for depressive personality disorder. The moods of individuals with this disorder tend to be dominated by dejection, gloominess, cheerlessness, joylessness, and unhappiness. Their self-view is that of inadequacy, worthlessness, and low self-esteem. They tend to be critical, blaming and self-derogatory, brooding, and given to worry. They are also pessimistic and prone to feelings of guilt and remorse. In addition, they are negative, critical, and judgmental toward others.
   As with most other personality disorders, there is no known cause for the depressive personality disorder. However, a variety of factors may be causative. These include inherited traits, early childhood experiences, and a predisposition toward pessimism. It appears that individuals with this disorder are more likely to develop persistent depressive disorder than those with other personality disorders or depressive disorders.


Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Psychotherapy, particularly, cognitive behavior therapy, appears to be beneficial in treating mild and moderate forms of this disorder. Medications, particularly antidepressants, may be helpful in treating the symptoms of depression of this disorder. Medication may be combined with psychotherapy for moderate to severe forms of the disorder.




Detoxification is the process of safely removing addictive drugs from an individual’s body.

• Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain, which involves compulsive and uncontrolled pursuit of reward or relief with substance use or other compulsive behaviors.
• Anxiety is a negative emotional state characterized by feelings of nervousness, worry, and apprehension about imagined danger.
• Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that slow the nervous system and are prescribed to relieve nervousness and tension, to induce sleep, and to treat other symptoms. They are highly addictive.
• Recovery is a series of steps an individual takes to improve his or her wellness and health while living a self-directed life and striving to reach his or her highest potential.
• Seizure is an episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that results in changes in the brain and in behavior.


Detoxification is the process of removing toxic substances (e.g., drugs, alcohol, mind-altering chemicals)





from an individual’s body, usually, under the care of a physician. Individuals who use drugs or alcohol can develop a physical dependence over time. Abruptly stopping the use of alcohol and drugs can result in significant withdrawal symptoms. It is extremely important for an individual with an addiction who is going through the detoxification process to be observed and treated by a health-care professional, as several drugs can result in life-threatening situations. For example, an individual who consumes alcohol or benzodiazepines on a daily basis can have a seizure if the individual abruptly stops using the substance on his or her own. Often, an individual will be prescribed a medication while being treated for detoxification so that he or she is more comfortable and also that he or she does not experience a seizure.
   When an individual becomes physically dependent on drugs or alcohol, the individual may experience severe withdrawal symptoms when he or she stops using. Depending on the drug being abused, symptoms will vary. For example, an individual who is withdrawing (detoxifying) from heavy use of alcohol may experience increased heart rate, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, shaking, and seizures. An individual who is withdrawing from benzodiazepines may experience difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps, irritability, restlessness, seizures, and even death. The first step to recovery for individuals with addiction is detoxification.


Treatment for detoxification is designed to remove toxins that are left in the body. An individual can go through the process of detoxification at several facilities (e.g., private clinics, addiction clinics, and mental health centers). An individual can also participate in an inpatient or outpatient treatment program for detoxification. This option is very beneficial because medical staff closely observes individuals. Furthermore, individuals are more likely prevented from using alcohol or drugs in an inpatient or outpatient program. Typically, the detoxification process can take less time when participating in an inpatient or outpatient treatment program.






Detoxification interventions are of three types: medical, social, and a blending of the medical and social models of detoxification.


• Detoxification is the process of safely removing addictive drugs from an individual’s body.
• Methadone is a drug that reduces symptoms of withdrawal for people addicted to other drugs.
• Recovery is a series of steps an individual takes to improve his or her wellness and health while living a self-directed life and striving to reach his or her highest potential.
• Withdrawal is the unpleasant and potentially life-threatening physiological changes that occur due to the discontinuation of certain drugs after prolonged regular use.


When a person suffers from physical or mental impairment because of ingesting substances that are in the long term poisonous to the body, detoxification may be necessary before any other means can be used that will help improve his or her life situation. Everyone is exposed to toxic or poisonous elements during his





or her life. Through the lymph, circulatory and digestive systems, particularly the liver, kidneys, and stomach, the body naturally detoxifies itself. Urination and bowel movements are two ways in which this naturally occurs. Special detoxification treatments become necessary when the body’s natural processes can no longer handle the amount of dangerous substances in the body and become overwhelmed.
   In substance abuse treatment settings, detoxification is seen as a necessary precursor to other courses of treatment. It is considered the first step in recovery. Until the patient has removed the effects of toxic substances from his or her body, it is considered difficult, if not impossible, to deal with the psychological and psychosocial aspects of his or her problems. Medically supervised detoxification from drugs and alcohol is the safest way to achieve this goal. But this approach is relatively recent. It was not until 1958 that the American Medical Association (AMA) declared alcoholism was a disease. alcoholism and drug addictions were considered a moral or legal problem. They were not considered valid medical conditions that required medical intervention. By the 1970s more humane treatment of people with addictions was becoming the norm, for those suffering not only from alcoholism but also from drug addiction and other activities deemed chronic if not lethal.
   There are two traditional models of detoxification: a medical model and a social model. The major differences between the two are that the medical model uses physicians, nursing staff, and medication to assist people through the sometimes fatal and painful withdrawal stages of detoxification. Those who prefer the social model do not see the need for medication or routine medical care. They choose to conduct detoxification in a nonmedical setting that relies on the presence of caring people, professional and otherwise, to help the person through the difficult process of detoxification.





Detoxification interventions are usually the first step in treating substance disorders.





   Today a blend of these two intervention models is often used, with nonmedical people monitoring psychological withdrawal symptoms and professional medical people addressing the symptoms of physical withdrawal and detoxification. Inpatient treatment protocols have become more sophisticated and complex often involving the use of multiple drugs, such as methadone, to aid in the process. Three of the most dangerous drugs to detox from are heroin, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. These drugs are currently considered the most dangerous due to detox side effects, including seizures, strokes, and even death.
   Most medical professionals working with substance-dependent clients discourage detoxification without medical supervision. The AMA continues to maintain that substance dependence is a disease, and it encourages physicians and other clinicians, health organizations, and policy makers to base all their activities on this premise. For mental health professionals, reliance on detoxification remains a necessary first step toward effective psychological treatment.



Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is defined as a significant impairment in the development of motor coordination that interferes with the ability to learn or to conduct the activities of daily life.


• Developmental relates to growth and the ability to learn new things, especially in regard to


the gradual learning and maturing process in children.

Although it is clear that children develop at different rates, poor motor coordination is recognized as a developmental problem. Sometimes children exhibit clumsiness or delays in activities such as crawling, walking, or dressing themselves. The term “developmental coordination disorder” refers to the difficulty in movement skills affecting children that is not due to intellectual, sensory, or neurological impairment. A key feature of DCD is difficulty in learning and performing everyday tasks at home, school, and play environments. It can affect as many as 6% of children who are between 5 and 11 years of age (National Institutes of Health, 2014). Occasionally, lack of coordination persists through adolescence and adulthood. This affects such things as handwriting or fine motor skills required for assembling puzzles or playing ball.
   There has been confusion in the area of DCD because experts like pediatricians, neurologists, educators, and occupational and physical therapists saw the condition from their own points of view and found it hard to find a unified perspective. The condition was often called developmental dyspraxia, apraxia, or ataxia. By 1994 there was general agreement on the name “developmental coordination disorder.” It describes a condition of significant problems in the development of motor coordination. The motor issues need to be distinct from medical conditions such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy or even pervasive developmental disorder.


It is suspected that children with a history of prenatal or perinatal difficulties exhibit a higher incidence of developmental coordination disorder. The problems experienced by children with DCD are usually a result of problems in the brain’s receptor system due to physical damage. Children with DCD may have a wide range of dysfunctions. These dysfunctions are often grouped into the areas of gross motor, fine motor, and psychosocial. Recently, the systems model has suggested a





complex interaction among various levels of the central nervous system. This usually results in impairments in such related areas as proprioception, motor programming, and the sequencing of muscle activities. These can appear in children as clumsiness walking, problems with their peers, or issues with handwriting. These problems can affect the ability to learn and to manage daily activities.


In diagnosing DCD, it is important to distinguish it from problems or disorders that may have overlapping or similar symptoms. These disorders include cerebral palsy, mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Those children who score below the 15th percentile on standardized tests of motor skills and having an IQ score above 69 would qualify for a diagnosis of DCD (National Institutes of Health, 2014). Research in DCD has emphasized the motor and academic outcomes of children rather than the long-term emotional and behavioral consequences of the disorder.
   There are two schools of thought on the persistence of DCD. One view holds that DCD is largely confined to childhood and that most children eventually learn or outgrow it. This approach may take longer and much more effort to acquire sufficient motor skills but it usually happens. Another view is that improvement of DCD symptoms is not simply a matter of aging and that it continues to be a motor and a social problem in adolescence. Evidence of its effects can also be found in some adults who suffered from DCD.


Current treatment focuses on helping children improve their motor and psychosocial challenges. Task-specific intervention is one of many approaches designed to improve the motor performance of children and young adults with motor learning difficulties. Among them are physical therapy, sensory integration, the process-oriented treatment approach, and perceptual motor training. It should be noted that there are studies which show that children who have received perceptual motor training have demonstrated motor


improvements equal to or greater than those of children who have received either sensory integration therapy or process-oriented treatment.



Developmental disabilities are conditions that restrict normal growth and activities whether physically, psychologically, educationally, or emotionally.


• Developmental relates to growth and the ability to learn new things, especially in regard to the gradual learning and maturing process in children.
• Disability means a physical or mental condition that limits a person’s movement, sense perception, or participation in normal physical or mental activities.


Developmental disabilities usually begin during pregnancy, childbirth, or early infancy. The term also includes disabilities that may happen later due to injury, infection, or a variety of other factors. Whatever the source, they often impact daily functioning and therefore can become a challenge that may last a lifetime.





Not surprisingly many disabilities are overlapping; for example, a person with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder may not do well in school, while a deaf person may experience specific emotional challenges in social interactions. “Developmental disabilities” is an umbrella term that describes a broad range of impairments that affect the growth and abilities of individuals in physical, learning, language, or behavior areas.
   Developmental disabilities occur fairly evenly among all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Despite this even distribution, some factors for increased risk and poorer prognosis are associated with the resources, education, and cultural norms of the parents. Recent estimates in the United States show that about one in six, or around 15% of children aged 3 through 17 years have one or more developmental disabilities, although levels of severity differ greatly (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). According to the Centers for Disease Control, developmental disabilities include autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, hearing/vision loss or impairment, intellectual disability, and learning disability.


Most developmental disabilities seem to be caused by a complex mix of factors. Some of the key factors include genetics, parental health, and other behaviors. These include smoking and drinking during pregnancy, complications during the birthing process, infections the mother might have during pregnancy or the baby might develop very early in life, and exposure of the mother or child to high levels of environmental toxins. An example of such toxins is lead. For some developmental disabilities, the cause is easy to pinpoint, but for many other conditions, the causes are not clear.
   At least 25% of hearing loss among babies is due to maternal infections during pregnancy, complications after birth, and head trauma. Some of the most common known causes of intellectual disability include fetal alcohol syndrome and genetic and chromosomal conditions, such as Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. In certain cases infections during pregnancy, such as an infection passed from animals to humans, can cause a developmental disability. Children who have a sibling or parent with an autism spectrum


disorder are at a higher risk of also having an autism spectrum disorder. Low birth weight, premature birth, multiple births, and infections during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for many developmental disabilities. Untreated newborn jaundice can cause a type of brain damage known as kernicterus. Children with this brain damage are more likely to have cerebral palsy, hearing and vision problems, and problems with their teeth. Early detection and treatment of newborn jaundice can prevent brain damage.

Parents are normally the best monitors and observers of the development of their children. If certain expected developmental milestones like smiling, interacting, talking, and walking are not reached within the expected range, then medical advice should be sought. Often the medical professional will join the parents in monitoring any perceived developmental delays or problems. If problems persist, the child should undergo developmental screening and evaluations to determine if the child’s skills and abilities are on track, delayed, or not present. The earlier the diagnosis is made, the greater the opportunity for help and improvement.


If a child exhibits developmental delays, it is important to get help as soon as possible. Early identification and intervention can have a significant impact on a child’s ability to learn new skills. In addition, early intervention can reduce the need for later more costly interventions over a longer period of time.
   People with developmental disabilities have physical, educational, or emotional deficits that require attention and help. Federal and state laws protect all those who are formally identified as having developmental disorders from discrimination. It is important for children and adults with disabilities to have access to health care and health programs in order to live as fully as they can, to stay well, and to be socially active. Health-care professionals are aware that conditions such as asthma, gastrointestinal symptoms, eczema and skin allergies, and migraine headaches have been found to be more common among children with





developmental disabilities.  it is especially important for children with developmental disabilities to see a health-care provider regularly. Many communities have independent living centers that are nonprofit, community-based agencies that help people with disabilities achieve and maintain self-sufficient lives within the community. Services offered include advocacy, information and referral, independent living skills training, and peer counseling.




Dexedrine is a prescription medication used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Its generic name is dextroamphetamine.


• Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a disorder characterized by significant problems with attention, hyperactivity, or acting impulsively that are not appropriate for an individual’s age.
• Narcolepsy is a condition of daytime sleepiness in which uncontrollable sleep attacks interfere with normal functioning.
• Stimulants are a class of drugs that increase brain activity and produce a sense of alertness, euphoria, endurance, and productivity


or suppress appetite. Examples are cocaine, amphetamines, and Ritalin.
• Tourette’s syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by tics (involuntary movements or vocalizations). Tics are preceded by a felt tension that is relieved after the tic is performed.


Dexedrine belongs to the class of medications known as stimulants. Dexedrine is used to treat poor concentration and impulse control problems common in ADHD, and to treat narcolepsy. ADHD is believed to be caused by a decrease in norepinephrine levels. Dexedrine appears to work by increasing norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the brain. The result in an increase in attention, concentration, appetite, energy level, judgment, memory, and impulse control. Dexedrine is also a standard treatment for narcolepsy. Dexedrine is available in a combination pill with the drug amphetamine (Adderall). The choice of using Dexedrine alone or in combination with other medications depends on the individual’s health history.

Dexedrine can be a habit-forming medication and should not be used for long periods or at higher doses than prescribed. It should not be used in those with a history of alcohol or substance abuse. Since it can lower seizure threshold, it is not appropriate for use by those with a seizure disorder. Dexedrine should not be used by those with glaucoma (high pressure in the eye), Tourette’s syndrome, or a family history of Tourette’s since it can worsen tics. Similarly, it should not be used by those taking or have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within the past 14 days. It must be used with caution by those with hyperthyroidism, high blood pressure, liver function impairment, kidney function impairment, and heart conditions, and by those with bipolar disorder since it can trigger mania. Dexedrine causes a withdrawal syndrome when stopped abruptly, so it should be tapered off gradually when discontinuing it. Dexedrine may be unsafe for





use during pregnancy and breast-feeding, and its use is not recommended.
   Common side effects of Dexedrine include stomach pain, nausea, loss of appetite, dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, euphoria, headache, weight loss, changes in blood pressure and heart rate, palpitations, tremor, dry mouth, unpleasant taste, diarrhea or constipation, visual disturbances, impotence, and sexual dysfunction. Growth retardation in children can occur with prolonged use. Side effects that need medical attention include suicidal thoughts, confusion, chest pain, or heart palpitations, shortness of breath, restlessness, hallucinations (seeing or hearing, things that are not really there), fainting, tics, and seizures.
   Dexedrine can increase, decrease, or alter the effects of other medications taken with it. Such interacting medications include antidepressant medications such as MAOIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Prozac and Paxil, and tricyclics such as Tofranil. Effexor can cause greater-than-expected weight loss when used with Dexedrine. Antacids and the glaucoma and diuretic drug acetazolamide decrease the excretion of Dexedrine from the body and may cause toxic levels to accumulate. Many herbal supplements may also interact with Dexedrine and cause toxicity, including ginseng and green tea.



DHEA is a hormone used for increasing cognitive functioning and slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s


disease and some medical conditions. Its technical name is dehydroepiandrosterone.


• Adrenal insufficiency exits when the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, aldosterone, and corti-costerone. Addison’s disease can result from it.
• Hormone is a chemical messenger that regulates such bodily functions as growth, development, metabolism, reproduction, and mood.

DHEA is produced naturally by the adrenal glands. It has a number of uses, including increasing cognitive performance; slowing the progression of Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, adrenal insufficiency, depression, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and erectile dysfunction; and improving sexuality and well-being. DHEA is also used to increase muscle mass, strength, and energy, but it is banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The body converts DHEA into male and female sex hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone.
   DHEA is also available as a nutritional supplement made from a substance found in soy and wild yams. Because of concerns about false claims, these supplements were taken off the U.S. market in 1985. But it was reintroduced after the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act was passed in 1994. DHEA levels in the body begin to decrease after age 30 and may be low in those with anorexia, end-stage kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, AIDS, and adrenal insufficiency, and in the critically ill. DHEA levels may also be depleted by a number of medications, including insulin, corticosteroids, opiates, and Danocrine. While evidence supports the short-term use of DHEA in the treatment of adrenal insufficiency, depression, and lupus, there is concern about its long-term use. Because DHEA can elevate levels of androgens and estrogens in the body, it could increase the risk of prostate, breast, ovarian, and other hormone-sensitive cancers. Therefore, it is not recommended for regular use without medical supervision. DHEA is being investigated and may eventually be





approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a prescription drug for treating systemic lupus erythematosus and improving bone mineral density in women with lupus who are taking steroid drugs for treatment. Clinical trials are being conducted on DHEA with anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder. Information on participation in a clinical trial is available at the website of the NIH Clinical center, http://www.cc.nih.gov.ezproxy.fau.edu/participate.



Because DHEA is a hormone it should be used under medical supervision, particularly those with or at risk for mood and psychotic disorders. Children and pregnant or breast-feeding women should not use it. Since it may alter liver function, those with liver disease should not use it. DHEA supplements may alter the levels estrogen and testosterone, which can increase the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer. Those taking DHEA supplements may develop blood clots, so people with clotting disorders, heart disease, and a history of stroke should avoid DHEA supplements. DHEA supplements can affect the levels of other hormones, such as insulin and thyroid hormone, and also affect cholesterol levels. Those with diabetes, high cholesterol, thyroid disorders, Cushing’s disease, and other hormonal disorders should be particularly cautious.
   Common side effects of DHEA supplements include acne, insomnia, fatigue, oily skin, abdominal pain, hair loss, nasal congestion, irregular heartbeats, and heart palpitations. Since DHEA supplements may influence the production of male and female hormones, facial hair growth and a deepening of the voice may occur in women. Men may develop male pattern baldness, aggressiveness, high blood pressure, breast enlargement, and shrinkage of the testicles.
   DHEA supplements may interfere with the effectiveness of antipsychotic medications such as Thorazine and Compazine. It may increase the effects of AZT (HIV medication), barbiturates, oral contraceptives, and benzodiazepines, such as Halcion, Xanax, and Valium.


Diagnosis is the process of identifying and labeling a medical or psychiatric disorder.


• Case conceptualization is a method and strategy for obtaining and organizing information, understanding and explaining maladaptive patterns, focusing treatment, anticipating challenges, and preparing for termination.
• Clinical assessment is the formal process of collecting clinical data to establish a diagnosis, to develop a case conceptualization, and to plan treatment.
• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Mental status examination is a clinical evaluation of an individual’s appearance, orientation, behavior, mood and affect, speech, thinking, perception, cognition, insight, and judgment.
• Psychiatric diagnosis is a form of diagnosis based on the identification and labeling of mental disorder based on meeting diagnostic criteria matching a particular disorder.



Diagnosis is a form of clinical assessment for the identification and labeling of a medical or psychiatric condition or disorder based on its signs and symptoms.





Clinical assessment has at least three goals. The first is to establish a psychiatric diagnosis based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria. The second is to develop a case conceptualization. The third is to plan treatment based on the diagnosis and case conceptualization. Of these three, establishing a psychiatric diagnosis is the first and, some would say, the most important step in clinical assessment.


A psychiatric diagnosis is arrived at by comparing specific symptoms and impairment against the criteria for a given clinical disorder. Psychiatrists, psychologists, and mental health counselors diagnose psychiatric (mental) disorders using the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM is a reference work consulted by these and other clinicians, including social workers, couples and family therapists, medical and nursing students, and pastoral counselors.
   The psychiatric diagnosis is based on a psychiatric evaluation (clinical assessment) that includes both psychiatric interview and observational data. Typically, a psychiatric interview includes questioning the individual about the reason for the diagnostic evaluation (clinical assessment); history of the present illness including symptoms, severity, and length of time involved; past psychiatric history; and developmental, psychosocial, and educational history. Additional data often includes information about health history and use of prescribed medications, alcohol, and street drugs. If the individual is unable or unwilling to provide such information, collateral information is sought. Information to better understand the individual’s present condition and past history comes from relatives, friends, or available medical and psychiatric records.
   An essential element of the psychiatric evaluation is a mental status examination, which is an assessment of the individual’s overall level of functioning at the time of the evaluation. Psychological tests that the examiner thinks are necessary to establish or rule out a specific diagnosis may be undertaken.
   A diagnosis is used to establish a prognosis (prediction of response to treatment) for the individual and


to foster communication among health-care professionals involved in the individual’s care. Furthermore, a formal DSM diagnosis may be required by insurers to pay for treatment services.


The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is a diagnostic classification framework that characterizes mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.


• Mental disorder is a mental or behavioral pattern or anomaly that causes either distress or an impaired ability to function in daily life. It is also known as a mental illness or psychiatric disorder.
• Phenomenological refers to a method of classification that emphasizes externally observable phenomena and descriptions rather than their underlying nature or origin.


The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) provides a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders.





The DSM is used in the United States as well as in other countries. It is used by clinicians, researchers, drug regulation agencies, insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, and policy makers. DSM is published by the American Psychiatric Association. Two other diagnostic manuals are the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization and the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual published by the Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations. The stated purpose of the DSM is threefold: to provide a useful guide to clinical practice, to facilitate research and improve communication among clinicians and researchers, and to serve as an educational tool for teaching psychopathology.
Developments and Current Status
The origins of the DSM are in census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army and Veterans Administration (VA) manual. The DSM was substantially revised in 1980. The six revisions since its first publication in 1952 incrementally added to the number of mental disorders while removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. The last major revision is DSM-5 in 2013. While the DSM is the official diagnostic system for mental disorders in the United States, it is also used widely in Europe and other parts of the world. Throughout its history, the DSM coding system is designed to correspond with the codes used in the ICD, although not all codes may match at all times because the two publications are not revised syn-chronously. The following is a brief description of all the DSM manuals from the beginning through DSM-5. DSM-I. In 1952 DSM was published by the American Psychiatric Association. It listed 106 diagnostic categories and was merely 130 pages long. In 1949, the World Health Organization published the sixth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), which included a section on mental disorders for the first time. Soon afterward, the APA Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics was tasked with developing a diagnostic manual for use in the United States. It based this manual on the structure and conceptual framework of “Medical 203” of the VA system and ICD nomenclature. Many passages of text were identical to those in Medical 203. DSM-I


included several categories of personality disturbance, neurosis, psychosis, and acute and psychophysiological reactions.
DSM-II. In 1968 DSM-II was published and listed
182 diagnostic categories. It was 134 pages long. It was remarkably similar to the DSM-I. It appeared prior to ICD-9, which was published in 1975. While the designation “reaction” was dropped, the term “neurosis” was retained. Both the DSM-I and the DSM-II reflected the predominant psychodynamic view. However, both included biological perspectives and concepts from a descriptive system of classification. Symptoms were not specified in detail for specific disorders. Many were seen as reflections of broad underlying conflicts or maladaptive reactions to life problems, rooted in a distinction between neurosis and psychosis (roughly, anxiety/depression broadly in touch with reality, or hallucinations/delusions appearing disconnected from reality). Sociological and biological knowledge was incorporated, in a model that did not emphasize a clear boundary between normality and abnormality. The idea that personality disorders did not involve emotional distress was discarded.
DSM-III. In 1980 DSM-III was published and listed
265 diagnostic categories. The original purpose of this revision was to make the DSM nomenclature consistent with the then current version of ICD. Another purpose was to improve the uniformity and validity of psychiatric diagnosis, and to standardize diagnostic practices. The establishment of these criteria was an attempt to facilitate the pharmaceutical regulatory process. The psychodynamic view was abandoned, in favor of a phenomenological (descriptive) model. Mental disorders were conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome. The personality disorders were placed on axis II along with mental retardation. Besides the expansion of diagnostic categories, the most notable difference that would greatly impact clinical practice was the addition of a multiaxial system. This means an individual is evaluated on five axes or dimensions, each representing a different aspect of functioning. Axes I and II refer to types of psychological or psychiatric disorders, while Axes III through V represent general medical conditions, psychosocial and environmental problems, and a global assessment of functioning.




In 1987 the DSM-III-R was published as a revision of DSM-III. Six categories were deleted while others were added. Controversial diagnoses such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder and masochistic personality disorder were considered and discarded. “Sexual orientation disturbance” was also removed and was largely subsumed under “sexual disorder not otherwise specified,” which can include “persistent and marked distress about one’s sexual orientation.” Altogether, DSM-III-R contained 292 diagnoses and was 567 pages long. Further efforts were made for the diagnoses to be purely descriptive.
DSM-IV. In 1994, DSM-IV was published with 297
disorders. Revisions were based on research reviewed by work groups and results from multicenter field trials relating diagnoses to clinical practice. A major change from previous versions was the inclusion of a clinical significance criterion to almost half of all the categories, which required symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some personality disorder diagnoses were deleted or moved to the appendix.
DSM-IV-TR. In 2000, a text revision of the DSM-IV,
known as the DSM-IV-TR, was published. The diagnostic categories and the vast majority of the specific criteria for diagnosis were unchanged. The text sections giving extra information on each diagnosis were updated, as were some of the diagnostic codes to maintain consistency with the ICD.
DSM-5. In 2013, DSM-5 was published. It includes the same number of disorders as in DSM-IV. A number of changes in structure as well as content were made since the last edition. The most obvious is that the multiaxial system has been removed. The five Axes (I, II, III, IV, V) had been the focal point of DSM since it was introduced in 1978 with DSM-III. DSM-5 now documents diagnoses in a nonaxial manner, which combines the former Axes I, II, and III with separate notations for psychosocial and contextual factors (formerly Axis IV) and disability (formerly Axis V). Other changes involve the addition of some new diagnoses, the removal of others, and revision of criteria for several disorders. These changes will align DSM-5 with the World Health Organization’s International


Classification of Diseases, eleventh edition (ICD-11). They are expected to foster improved communication and common use of diagnoses across disorders. DSM-5 is comprised of three sections. The first section describes how to use the updated manual. The second section describes the diagnostic categories. The third section includes cultural formulations and diagnostic conditions that are yet considered formal disorders.
   Overall, three main changes are evident in the various editions of DSM. First, there has been a clear shift from defining mental disorders by their causes toward defining disorders as clusters of symptoms. Second, there is a coordination of diagnoses with the ICD. Third, there has been increased use of field trials and statistical analysis in evaluating the adequacy of diagnostic terms and criteria.



Dialectical behavior therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) which focuses on coping with stress, regulating emotions, and improving relationships. It is also known as DBT.

• Behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors.





• Cognitive behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.
• Cognitive restructuring is psychotherapy technique for replacing maladaptive thought patterns with more constructive thoughts and beliefs.
• Cognitive therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing distorted thinking patterns.
• Dialectic is a form of discussion that resolves differences between two views rather than concluding that only one is true.
• Schemas are core beliefs or assumptions about one’s self and the world.
• Schema therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive schemas.



Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a type of CBT that focuses on learning skills to cope with stress, regulate emotions, and improve relationships. DBT is an outgrowth of behavior therapy in that both focus on behavioral deficits and emotional excesses (inability to regulate emotions). Like CBT, DBT emphasizes a collaborative relationship between client and therapist. Both utilize learning principles, analyze triggers and environmental prompts, explore schemas and emotions, and utilize homework. In addition, recognize the importance of empathic responding.
   Unlike traditional CBT, DBT emphasizes emotion regulation more than maladaptive (problematic) beliefs and schemas. Cognitively oriented CBT insists that dysfunctional feelings and behaviors are due to maladaptive beliefs and schemas that produce consistently biased judgments and cognitive errors. Instead, DBT focuses on how maladaptive schemas are initially formed. It explores schemas and the underlying dialectic conflicts that produced them rather than using cognitive restructuring to change them. DBT therapists attempt to connect clients’ maladaptive beliefs


to underlying affect and need, and then assist them to reinterpret their belief systems based on greater awareness of their feelings and needs.
   The core strategies in DBT are “validation” and “problem solving.” DBT attempts to validate clients’ behavior and demonstrate an understanding of their difficulties and suffering. Problem solving focuses on the establishment of necessary skills. DBT has four primary treatment modes: individual therapy, skills training in a group, telephone contact, and therapist consultation. Following an initial period of pretreatment involving assessment, commitment, and orientation to therapy, DBT focused on the specific targets for that stage, which are arranged in a definite hierarchy of relative importance. These include decreasing suicidal behaviors, decreasing therapy-interfering behaviors, decreasing behaviors that interfere with the quality of life, increasing behavioral skills, decreasing behaviors related to post-traumatic stress, improving self-esteem, and attaining individual targets negotiated with the client.

DBT was developed for the treatment of borderline personality disorder by American psychologist Marsha Linehan (1943–). Linehan developed this approach after finding that traditional psychotherapeutic approaches were ineffective in treating suicidal individuals with borderline personality disorder. She focused her approach on skills training because these individuals had considerable skill deficits. She also found that skills training was best accomplished in weekly didactic groups. These groups use a step-by-step format to teach four sets of skills. These skill sets are core mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance.
Core mindfulness. This is the ability to take control of one’s mind rather than being controlled by it. Mindfulness focuses one’s attention by a process of observing, describing, and participating from a nonjudgmental perspective. This allows for more objective, effective, and meaningful experiences in the present moment.
Interpersonal effectiveness. This is the ability to
communicate and express oneself effectively while





understanding and remaining committed to one’s goals and self-respect. It includes being able to ask for what one needs, say no, and cope with interpersonal conflict. Skills training includes assertive communication, interpersonal problem solving, and negotiation.
Emotion regulation. This is the ability to regulate
your emotions by understanding the relationship between thoughts, feelings, body sensations, and behaviors. It also includes awareness of one’s vulnerabilities and how they affect one’s emotional states. These include inadequate sleep, misuse of medications, lack of exercise, and not incorporating positive experiences in daily life.
Distress tolerance. This is the ability to get through
a difficult time without making the situation worse. Being able to tolerate distress (painful emotions) reduces the likelihood of engaging in self-destructive behaviors. Distress tolerance teaches the use of distraction, radical acceptance, and evaluating pros/cons as alternatives.
   Research indicates that DBT is most effectively accomplished in an inpatient, partial hospitalization or residential treatment setting rather than in outpatient and private practice. DBT is best implemented with a treatment team in which one therapist provides skills training and another provides individual therapy. This is best accomplished when other therapists can provide a consultation function and when all therapists have access to a therapist consultation group for support.
   More recently, DBT has been modified and extended for use with other personality disorders as well as Axis I or symptom disorders such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and substance disorders. DBT is an outgrowth of behavior therapy but is less cognitive than traditional CBT since DBT assumes that cognitions are less important than affect regulation. DBT has been adapted for private practice settings. It is recommended that the skill training component be best provided by another therapist; it is not absolutely necessary. Also, private practice clinicians using DBT would do well to have access to a psychotherapy consultant if involvement in a therapist consultation group is not possible.




Dictionary of Occupational Titles 

This book source was created in 1939 by the U.S. Department of Labor as a reference list of occupations for use by those interested in or seeking job placement.


• Occupational information describes useful vocational data and facts, including career descriptions, requirements, benefits, and possible compensation for students, job seekers, and business/industry professionals to assist them in navigating the world of work.
• Occupational Information Network (O*NET) is the online occupational website that was created in 1991 to replace the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) print publication.


The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) was published by the U.S. Department of Labor in 1939 to offer job seekers, employers, and career advisors with a comprehensive list of occupations and facts related to those. Containing over 17,000 vocational titles and descriptions, this first edition categorized jobs as skilled, semiskilled, or unskilled. The first edition of the DOT was also used to properly place World War II veterans in careers commensurate with their skills on their return. Second, third, and fourth editions of the DOT were published in 1949, 1965, and 1977, respectively.





Supplements to the fourth edition followed periodically to update the list of job categories and modify the skills required (e.g., technology related) and to notify readers of changes in workforce demand. A final update occurred in 1991. Soon after, the DOT was replaced by an online source, the Occupational Information Network, or O*NET. This website provides a comprehensive, up-to-date guide for students, trainees, workers, and employers to gather vocational information. Though it now contains only 13,000 job categories, fewer than the DOT had in 1939, these categories are now organized under occupational umbrellas, making it easier for searchers to scan through related fields of interest. The O*NET system houses a variety of useful sources, including the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, the Directory of Occupational Titles, and the Occupational Job Outlook. There are multiple ways to search the O*NET system, including sorting by job category, description, skills, interests, and/or work values.

O*NET is readily used by career counselors and advisors as a valuable reference tool to help assess client’s work values, interests, and aptitudes and assist in finding proper placement. Given O*NET’s wide range of search capabilities and the vast amount of information it contains, it is a popular site for those seeking employment or those looking to attract good employees. The system is updated on a biannual basis to allow for the most current information to be obtained by users.




Disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual. Disability evaluation is a formal determination of the degree of a physical, mental, or emotional disability.


• Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a civil rights law intended to protect against discrimination based on disability. It was originally signed in 1990 and amended in 2008.
• Disability is any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being.
• Handicap is a disadvantage for a given individual that limits or prevents the fulfillment of a role that is normal.
• Impairment is any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function.

In the United States disability has been legally defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act. Disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual. Major life activities include self-care, full range of movement, communication, vision, hearing, working, learning, and social relating. Disability can be caused by congenital (birth related), traumatic (accidental), or other factors, and vary widely in severity. They may be temporary or permanent, correctable, or irreversible. Physical disabilities include blindness, deafness, deformity, muscular and nervous disorders, paralysis, and loss of limbs. Mental disabilities are of two types: mental illness and mental retardation.





   The terms “impairment,” “disability,” and “handicap” are often used synonymously. However, there are technical distinctions and different meanings for these terms. The most commonly accepted definitions are those of the World Health Organization in “The International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Health.” Basically, “impairment” refers to a problem with a structure or organ of the body, whereas “disability” is a functional limitation with regard to a particular activity. In contrast, “handicap” refers to a disadvantage in filling a role in life related to an individual’s peer group. As already noted, disabilities can be correctable. Thus, an individual may not be able to walk because of an impairment of mobility (movement) such as paralysis. However, if this individual uses a wheelchair and is able to perform daily activities, then the impairment is presumably limited.


The presence or absence of diagnosis of disability is essential in determining whether an individual meets the eligibility criteria for Social Security. It is also used to determine eligibility for benefits and income under disability insurance and for workmen’s compensation benefits. A disability evaluation is the formal assessment procedure used in making this determination.
   A mental disability evaluation examination is usually performed by a psychologist or psychiatrist. Intelligence testing and/or memory testing is commonly used when the alleged disability is due to learning disabilities, inability to read or write, a stroke, organic brain disorders, accident, or mental retardation A psychiatric evaluation and mental status examination is used when the alleged disability is due to personality disorder, an anxiety or mood disorder, or schizophrenia.
   The physician or psychologist who performs the examination sends a written report to a specified Social Security board, a disability insurer, or a workman’s compensation board. The report contains an opinion about the examinee’s capacity to remember and understand instructions and to deal with supervisors and coworkers, and with work and life stresses. Based on


this input, the board or insurer determines the disability and its extent.




Disinhibited social engagement disorder is a mental disorder in children characterized by an overly familiar and culturally inappropriate behavior with strangers.


• Attachment is the emotional bond between children and caregivers that provides a secure (healthy) base from which children are able to safely explore their environment and relate to others.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.
• Fetal alcohol syndrome is a medical condition characterized by birth defects and learning and behavioral problems in children resulting from the mother’s alcohol use during pregnancy.
• Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder characterized by nightmares, emotional numbing, and recurrent flashbacks of a





traumatic event that an individual experienced or witnessed.
• Reactive attachment disorder is a mental disorder characterized by disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness.
• Trauma and stressor-related disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by exposure to a traumatic or stressful event. These include post-traumatic stress disorder, reactive attachment disorder, and disinhibited social engagement disorder.


Disinhibited social engagement disorder is one of the trauma and stressor-related disorders. This disorder is characterized by a pattern of behavior that is culturally inappropriate and overly familiar with relative strangers. Such behavior violates ordinary social customs and cultural boundaries. In some ways, this disorder is the mirror opposite of reactive attachment disorder. Whereas children with reactive attachment disorder cannot easily relate to individuals they know, those with disinhibited social engagement disorder relate indiscriminately to individuals they do not know. They show little anxiety and no distrust of those strangers as they engage in culturally inappropriate physical contact and displays of affection. These children tend to be happy and affectionate around strangers. They may or may not be this way with their parents or caregivers. Strangers may view these children as clingy. However, they are likely to become emotionally sensitive and anxious if strangers seem to reject their affection. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, children can be
diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a pattern of behavior in which they seek out attention and contact with unfamiliar adults. They show a noticeable and concerning familiarity with strangers, such as inappropriate verbal and physical interactions. They may go off with strangers without hesitation. They may also not be aware of their caregiver in these unfamiliar settings. Their pattern of social neglect is evident by repeated changes in the primary caregiver or limited opportunities to form developmentally appropriate connections


with caregivers. Finally, this diagnosis can be made if the child is at least nine months of age (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is not well understood. However, social neglect is often present in the first few months of life in children diagnosed with this disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Children may respond to such limited displays of caring by actively seeking other sources of security and nurture. Then, having learned that parents or caretakers cannot be depended upon to care for and protect them, they look for others who might meet their needs and attempt to engage them in a friendly or overly friendly manner. Besides such neglect, repeated changes in the primary caregiver and limited opportunities to form appropriate connections and secure (healthy) attachments with caregivers may also be factors that contribute to the development of this disorder. There may also be a biological bases for this disorder. The indiscriminate social behavior seen in disinhibited social engagement disorder is also noted in some other disorders. These include cases of fetal alcohol syndrome even where there is no history of social neglect.


The treatment of this disorder usually involves psychological interventions. The active involvement of the child’s primary caregiver is essential. Establishing a sense of safety and security between the child and the caregiver is the first goal of treatment. Once such trust and consistency is formed, the child is less likely to seek comfort from strangers. Caregivers are then taught how to help their child set interpersonal boundaries. Cognitive behavior therapy can help in reducing stress and negative emotions associated with caring for a child with this disorder.









Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a lack of self-control.


• Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a mental disorder characterized by difficulty focusing as well as being overly active. It is commonly referred to as ADHD.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Family therapy is a method of therapy that seeks to create change by improving the relationships and rules of the family.
• Personality disorders is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behavior, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.


Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders are a category of mental disorders that are characterized by the inability to regulate one’s behavior, emotional responses, or both. This group of disorders includes oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive


disorder, and conduct disorder. A key factor that differentiates this group of disorders from disorders is that individuals with this group of disorders act in a way that violates the rights of others or social rules. The prevalence of these disorders varies, but as a rule, they tend to affect males more frequently than females (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). It is important to note that many of the symptoms of these disorders appear in the course of normal childhood development. Therefore, the occasional occurrence of some symptoms does not necessarily mean that an individual has, or will develop, one of these disorders. This group of disorders also includes antisocial personality disorder. However, that disorder is listed primarily as a personality disorder in DSM-5. A brief description of these DSM-5 disorders follows.
Conduct disorder. It is characterized by a pattern of
behavior that violates the rights of others. This disorder represents a pattern of symptoms that is dominated by a lack of behavioral regulation. This disorder is one of the most severe of this category. Individuals with this disorder may exhibit a pattern of hurting other people and animals, and destroying property. Some individuals with this disorder may also lack guilt about their actions or empathy toward others. To be diagnosed with this disorder, an individual must exhibit a number of symptoms that may include fighting (with or without a weapon), bullying, torturing animals, sexual assault, purposefully destroying property, breaking into someone’s home or vehicle, theft, sneaking out of his or her home, and skipping school. Prevalence of this disorder is estimated to be approximately 4% of the population (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). For some, this disorder manifests in childhood; for others, it may manifest in adolescence or adulthood. For those who develop this disorder as a child, their outcome is often worse than for those who develop it later. Treatment for this disorder may include psychotherapy, family therapy, and medication.
Kleptomania. It is characterized by impulsive
stealing. The principal difference between kleptomania and thievery is that individuals with this disorder steal because they are excited by it or feel tension that is released when stealing, whereas thievery involves stealing for monetary gain. The prevalence if this disorder is rare, affecting less than 1% of the population (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However,





this disorder is associated with up to 25% of individuals who shoplift. For an individual to be diagnosed with this disorder, he or she must demonstrate a pattern of stealing that is not for monetary gain. The individual must experience a tension that is released by stealing followed by pleasure (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Treatment for this disorder typically involves psychotherapy.
Intermittent explosive disorder. It is characterized
by a pattern of behavioral outburst cause by an inability to regulate one’s emotions and impulses. This disorder represents a pattern of symptoms that are not dominated by either an inability to regulate one’s behavior or emptions but approximately divided between the two. One of the common features of this disorder is aggression toward others. This aggression may be physical or verbal and far exceeds that which is normal for the individual’s age or the situation where it is expressed. Most often, there is little or no provocation preceding the outburst. For this diagnosis to apply, the individual must exhibit a pattern of aggression that does not result in harm to others or property, which occurs at least twice a week for three consecutive months. However, if the consequences of the individual’s actions are more severe and others or property is harmed, only three outbursts in a given year are required. Also, the individual must be at least six years of age and the aggression cannot have been preplanned and excessive. The prevalence of this disorder is estimated to be 2.7% (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This disorder usually begins in late childhood but may affect people well into middle age. Treatment for this disorder may include psychotherapy, family therapy, and medication.
Oppositional defiant disorder. It is characterized by
a pattern of irritability, moodiness, or defiance. This disorder represents a pattern of symptoms dominated by a lack of emotional regulation. This disorder is not to be confused with the otherwise normal childhood mood fluctuations or argumentativeness. The key differentiator is that these symptoms are persistent. For this diagnosis to apply, the individual must exhibit a number of symptoms to suggest that he or she is angry, temperamental, purposefully annoying, blaming, argumentative, or spiteful. Most important, the individual must demonstrate this with someone who is not a sibling and for at least six months. In addition, the individual must


demonstrate these symptoms at least once a week or more, depending on age (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Like all disorders, the social and cultural setting of the child is important to consider when making a diagnosis. The prevalence of this disorder is estimated to be 3.3% (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The disorder is most likely to manifest prior to grade school. Individuals who experience this disorder may later develop conduct disorder and may be a greater risk for developing other mental disorders. Also, it is common for individuals suffering from this disorder to also have ADHD. Treatment for this disorder may include psychotherapy, family therapy, and medication.
Pyromania. It is characterized by multiple episodes
of starting fires. Individuals who experience this disorder not only set fires but also are obsessed or fascinated by fire. The prevalence of this disorder as a standalone diagnosis is very rare, affecting less than one-third of 1% of the population (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However, it does co-occur more frequently with other disorders. For someone to be diagnosable with this disorder, the individual must intentionally set multiple fires. The individual must experience emotional excitement, relief, or pleasure associated with setting the fire and the aftermath. Also, the individual must not have a cause or motive to set fires aside from his or her own interest or fascination in fire itself, such as in the case of criminal arson (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). As this disorder is often one of multiple disorders that occur in an individual, treatment varies depending on the other diagnosis but will typically involve psychotherapy aimed at changing the beliefs and behaviors surrounding fire.








Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is a mental disorder in children characterized by a severe and frequent temper tantrums that interfere with daily functioning.


• Bipolar and related Disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by changes in mood and in energy (e.g., being highly irritable and impulsive while not needing sleep). These disorders include bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic disorder.
• Depression is an emotional state characterized by feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, guilt, or reduced ability to enjoy life. It is not considered a mental disorder unless it significantly disrupts one’s daily functioning.
• Depressive disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a sad or irritable mood and cognitive and physical changes that significantly disrupt the individual’s daily functioning. These disorders include major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
• Dysregulation is a problem with the control of physical or emotional functions.
• Temper tantrums are disruptive behaviors or emotional outbursts displayed in response to unmet needs or desires.


Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is one of a group of depressive disorders. It is characterized by


severe and persistent irritability resulting in temper tantrums and persistent anger or irritability between the tantrums. Both interfere with children’s ability to function at home, in school, or with their friends. Prior to DSM-5, many with this symptom pattern were likely to be labeled as “bipolar children.” Some of these children were diagnosed with bipolar disorder even though they seldom met all the symptoms and criteria. Research suggests that most will not go on to develop bipolar disorder as adults. Instead, children with chronic irritability are more likely to develop depressive and/or anxiety disorders when they become adults (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   In terms of mood symptoms, children with this disorder can be irritable, upset, or moody from time to time. They may switch rapidly from irritable, easily annoyed, and angry mood states to silly, goofy, and giddy states of elation. They can experience periods of sadness almost every day. During adolescence this may be demonstrated by suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Often these children are very bright and capable but are greatly challenged by this disorder.
   Occasional temper tantrums are a normal part of growing up. However, when children are continually irritable or angry or when temper tantrums are frequent, intense, and ongoing, it may suggest this depressive disorder. Such individuals (6 to 18 years of age) are probably fighting off depression or at least fighting to overcome imagined burdens. While anxiety reflects the individual’s awareness of a burden to overcome, expressed frustration, irritability, and anger reflect the individual’s efforts to react against and reach some resolution.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit chronic irritability that contributes to recurrent frustrations and temper outbursts. These outbursts occur more than three times per week and their moods between temper outbursts are persistently irritable or angry. The symptoms have been present for at least a year and the irritability and temper has been expressed across at least two settings, such as at home, school, or work, and contribute to significant functional disruption in those environments. This diagnosis can be given only to those between the ages of 6 and 18. Finally, this





disorder cannot have been caused by a substance, medication, or a medical condition or other mental disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is not well understood. It may be that genetic, environmental, and temperamental (personality) factors are operative (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Because it is a mood disorder it is likely that it could result from a combination of biological predispositions and environmental conditions. It can run in families suggesting a genetic basis, or it can be a result of stressful environments in which the child lives. It may also be that a recent death in the family, a divorce, or relocation is a factor. Some children have neurological disorders like migraine headaches that may account for their persistent irritability. Or, their mood dysregulation may be associated with early psychological trauma and abuse.
   As with other mood and conduct disorders in children, diagnosis is often delayed or mistaken for other conditions. Before a correct diagnosis is made, other diagnoses can be given. These include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, separation anxiety disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and other conduct disorders. Even after the disruptive mood dysregulation disorder diagnosis is given, many children continue to be diagnosed with one or more of these diagnoses as well. Therefore, children with it and other diagnoses should be comprehensively evaluated and treated for these issues.


Effective treatment of this disorder is individualized to the needs of the particular child and family. It usually includes individual therapy. Consulting with the child’s family and school are usually necessary and helpful. Parents of children with this disorder need to fully understand it. For this reason, the therapist might meet with parents and assist them in dealing more effectively with their child or adolescent. Parents and teachers are helped to analyze the triggers and the purpose of their tantrums. They learn that when these disruptions longer serve a useful purpose, children can learn alternative ways of getting their needs met and relating in a healthier way with peer and family


members. It may also be necessary for family therapy to address the family behaviors that promote the disruptive behaviors. Depending on the age of the child, medication may be prescribed. Medication, such as Ritalin and Risperdal, has been used to reduce impulsivity and irritability.




Dissociative amnesia is a dissociative disorder characterized by the inability to remember important personal information beyond what could be explained by normal forgetfulness. It is also known as psychogenic amnesia.


• Amnesia is the inability to recall past events or retain new information. It usually occurs as a result of physical or psychological trauma.
• Depersonalization is a mental state of detachment or a sense of being “outside” oneself and observing one’s actions or thoughts.





• Dissociation is a psychological process in which individuals experience being disconnected from their sensory experience, sense of self (identity), or personal history.
• Dissociative disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a disturbance of self, memory, awareness, or consciousness and which cause impaired functioning.
• Dissociative fugue is a dissociative disorder characterized by a temporary loss of personal identity, moving to a new location, and assuming a new identity.
• Dissociative identity disorder is a dissociative disorder characterized by having more than one distinct identity. Previously it was referred as multiple personality disorder.
• Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder characterized by unwanted recollections or a reexperiencing of a traumatic event with arousal symptoms.


Dissociative amnesia is a dissociative disorder in which the characteristic feature is the sudden and temporary loss of ability to recall important personal information. This disorder is usually a reaction to experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event or violent crime. The loss of memory can involve information about a specific topic or memories of the immediate or distant past. It is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness, and it cannot be due to a head injury, alcohol-induced blackouts, seizure disorder, or electroconvulsive therapy. Unlike the common portrayal of amnesia in television shows and movies, dissociative amnesia rarely involves a total loss of recall.
   A hallmark of this disorder is its rapid onset and rapid recovery. In contrast, recovery of amnesia from organic or medical causes is gradual and is rarely complete. These memories are not actually lost. Rather, they are buried but are not readily accessible. However, they can resurface spontaneously or be accessed in psychotherapy. Individuals with dissociative amnesia may develop depersonalization as part of the


disorder, but do not experience a change in identity, which is characteristic of dissociative fugue disorder. The incidence of dissociative amnesia increases during stressful or traumatic times, such as during a war or after a natural disaster. The likelihood of developing this disorder is quite rare in the United States. It is found in only 1.0% of American adult males and 2.6% of adult females (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they are unable to recall important information that is autobiographical in nature. This loss of memory can involve information about a specific topic or memories from the immediate or distant past such as traumatic or stressful events. It can include a loss of knowledge about one’s identity or loss of previous knowledge about the world. Besides displaying such symptoms, the individual’s functioning is also greatly affected in job, social, or other areas of life. This memory loss cannot be due to substance use, seizures, head injury, or other mental disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder, or neurological disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is exposure to an overwhelming stressor such as combat, sexual assault, accidents, natural disasters, and extreme conflict or emotional stress (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Genetics may also have a role since this disorder tends to run in families.


Treatment begins with a comprehensive assessment of the triggering event, current stressors, medical history, psychiatric history and treatment, history of alcohol and substance use, and history of trauma and abuse. Referral for a medical evaluation may be needed to rule out physical trauma, neurological conditions, and drug-induced causes. Treatment of amnesia depends on the root cause of amnesia. Psychotherapy can be helpful for amnesia caused by emotional trauma. The goal is to safely express and process painful lost memories. It may also involve developing new coping skills, improving relationships, and restoring functioning.





Providing a supportive environment may be sufficient for spontaneous resolution to occur.


Dissociative disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a disturbance of self, memory, awareness, or consciousness and which cause impaired functioning.


• Antianxiety medications are prescribed drugs that relieve anxiety symptoms. They are also called anxiolytics or tranquilizers.

• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• Dissociation is a psychological process in which individuals experience being disconnected or detached from their sensory experience, sense of self (identity), or personal history.
• Dissociative fugue is a dissociative disorder characterized by a temporary loss of personal identity, moving to a new location, and assuming a new identity.

Dissociative disorders are a group of DSM-5 mental disorders that includes dissociative identity disorders, dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, and other specified dissociative disorder. The central features of these disorders are relatively severe dissociative symptoms and impairment of functioning. Dissociation is a detachment from reality. When individuals suffer from dissociative symptoms, they experience being removed or detached from reality. Dissociative symptoms are numerous and vary significantly in severity. Daydreaming is a non-pathological form of it, while depersonalization (sense that the self is unreal) is a pathological form of dissociation.
   Mild dissociation experiences include dreaming or being mad at one’s dog when he or she has had a bad day at work. These experiences are not nearly as severe as the experience of one of the dissociative disorders. In addition, these symptoms usually have a rapid onset and are distressing. It is important to note that the dissociative disorders are different from the psychotic disorders whereby individuals can no longer separate what is real and what is not, as in the case of





hallucinations. What follows is a brief description of the four DSM-5 dissociative disorders.
Dissociative identity disorder. This disorder is characterized by an individual having two or more distinct personalities or identities. Often, an individual suffering from this disorder functions as if each identity was a completely different, independent person. When one identity is being expressed, the individual will often not recall what the alternate identity has done. Some who suffer from this disorder maintain a “possessed” personality where a demon or spirit overtakes them. There is variance in the obviousness of the change in personality. For some, there is a dramatic shift between personalities; for others, the change is subtle. Prevalence of this disorder is estimated to be 1.5% and to affect slightly more males than females (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). One of the most important aspects of this disorder is that individuals suffering from it have a very high probability of suicide. Abuse and traumatic events in childhood are associated with the manifestation of this disorder. The vast majority of cases do not resolve on their own and need highly skilled treatment. Treatment of this disorder requires some form of psychotherapy. This disorder was formerly called multiple personality disorder.
Dissociative amnesia. Dissociative amnesia is a
dissociative disorder characterized by the inability to remember important personal information beyond what could be explained by normal forgetfulness. The information that cannot be recalled may be isolated to a specific period of time. Often, the event that cannot be recalled is of a stressful or traumatic nature. In other cases, individuals may suffer a complete loss of life history. This disorder is sometimes accompanied by dissociative fugue. It is found in only 1.0% of adult males and less than 3% of adult females (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Treatment for this disorder will most likely incorporate psychotherapy, as there are no medications shown to be effective with this disorder. In addition, hypnotherapy may be used. This disorder is also known as psychogenic amnesia.
Depersonalization/derealization disorder. Depersonalization/derealization disorder is a dissociative disorder characterized by a symptom of either detachment, a sense of being “outside” oneself or observing


one’s actions or thoughts (depersonalization), detachment from a sense of one’s surroundings, or both (derealization). Although relatively severe depersonalization/derealization is represented as a disorder, mild symptoms such as daydreams may manifest in otherwise normal-functioning individuals for short durations. The principal difference between normal experience and a qualifying disorder is the distress experienced by the individual and the duration of the symptoms. This disorder is most often caused by medical conditions or the ingestions of illicit drugs but may also be caused by extreme stress and trauma. It is relatively rare, occurring in less than 2% of the population (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Treatment for this disorder may include both medications and psychotherapy.
Other specified dissociative disorder. This disorder is characterized by dissociative symptoms that cause substantial distress or impairment but do not fit the necessary criteria of the preceding disorders. This disorder is best understood as a grouping of four specific subtypes. These subtypes include chronic but relatively mild dissociative symptoms related to one’s identity, loss of identity due to intense and prolonged coercion such as that which takes place in a cult. Others are short-term dissociative symptoms lasting less than one month as a result of a traumatic event, and significant and unusual loss of awareness related to one’s environment. The prevalence of this disorder is unknown as it represents a newly established disorder in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Like the other dissociative disorders, treatment may include both medication and psychotherapy. However, the psychotherapy of each subtype will be focused in the particular subtype.








Dissociative identity disorder is a mental disorder characterized by having more than one distinct identity or personality. Previously this disorder was known as multiple personality disorder.

• Amnesia is the inability to recall past events or retain new information. It usually occurs as a result of physical or psychological trauma.
• Borderline personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, affects, self-harm, and a high degree of impulsivity.
• Dissociate and dissociation is a detachment fromreality.Daydreamingisanon-pathological form of it, while depersonalization (a sense that the self is unreal) and dissociative identity disorder are pathological forms of dissociation.
• Dissociative disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by a disturbance of self, memory, awareness, or consciousness and which cause impaired functioning.



Dissociative identity disorder is one of the class of dissociative disorders characterized by the presence of two or more distinct alter egos (identities) within the same individual. Each alter ego is dominant at a particular time. Each alter helps the individual to cope with and meet the individual’s needs. Because there


can be 10 or more alters within the individual, it can be difficult to detect and diagnose the disorder early in its course. It may take six or more years of psychological treatment before the proper diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder is made. Because of the waxing and waning character of this disorder and the innumerable permutations of symptoms, the individual may present differently on different occasions. Accordingly, such individuals may receive many diagnoses.
   Those with this disorder usually enter psychotherapy for various concerns ranging from anxiety to sleep disorders. In the course of treatment these individuals may complain of new concerns like the sudden onset of dizziness, difficulty finding their parked car, indecision about small matters, or denial of actions that were observed by others. On further investigation, a different alter ego emerges or is discovered in the course of treatment. Other symptoms of this disorder include auditory hallucinations, amnesia, and sudden mood swings. In fact, depression is one the most common of this disorder. The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is also common, particularly in those who are lower functioning and engage in self-harmful behaviors.
   This disorder usually begins in early childhood, although it is usually diagnosed between the ages of late adolescence and early middle age. In their late 50s, many with this disorder identify with one of their more resilient alters. The likelihood of developing dissociative identity disorder is small among adults in the United States, with 1.6% being males and 1.4% females (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a disruption of identity, which involves the presence of two or more distinct identities. As a result of this disruption the individual experiences altered affect, behavior, memory, consciousness, sensory motor functioning, or overall perception. These symptoms may be reported by the individual or observed by others. Memory impairment regarding important personal information, recall of daily events, and recall of traumatic events also occur in this disorder. Besides the individual displaying such symptoms, the individual’s functioning is also greatly affected, including job, relationships,





or other areas of life. Furthermore, the disorder cannot be caused by a medication, substance use, or medical condition, such as seizures. Lastly, the disturbance is also not a part of any cultural or religious practices (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The cause of this disorder is usually severe and repeated trauma in childhood. It may involve severe emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, neglect, natural disaster, terrorism, war, or the loss of a parent. 

Approximately 90% of clients living with this disorder have experienced a repeated and severe history of physical and/or sexual abuse as children (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).


The ultimate goal of treatment of this disorder is the integration of all alters into a single personality. While this disorder is not very common, some with this disorder experience an integration of their various alters without treatment. For the rest, focused psychotherapy is the primary treatment strategy. The treatment of this disorder tends to be long, demanding, and painful. The initial goal is to establish a trusting relationship, while the intermediate goal is to maximize the individual’s functioning. However, some degree of conflict-free collaboration among the various alters may be the only realistic goal for some individuals. Currently, treatment places less emphasis on processing past trauma and more emphasis on improving functioning and helping individuals live more meaningful lives. Generally, medications have limited value in treating this disorder. But they can useful in treating symptoms such as depression, insomnia, and panic.

Dissociative personality disorder is mental disorder characterized by dissociation as a central personality trait.

Dissociative personality disorder is a personality disorder in which an individual’s dominant pattern involves dissociation. This characteristic may be expressed in many ways. For some, it may be confusion or the inability to recall a memory, while others may forget entire periods of their life. In the most severe cases, individuals may take on completely new identities or experience multiple identities. It is believed that this personality type results from early abuse by their primary caregiver.
   While dissociative personality is not a diagnosis in DSM-5, it does share some characteristics of dissociative identity disorder. However, dissociative personality disorder is described in the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM). According to the PDM (2006), the dissociative personality disorder is diagnosable by the following criteria. Individuals are preoccupied with denying traumatic events. Their basic emotion is fear or anger. Their basic belief or view of themselves is that they are fragile or susceptible to frequent suffering. Their basic belief or view of others is that others are the dangerous, exploitive, oppressive, or saviors. Accordingly, they protect themselves from their belief about the world by dissociating their experience.
   The exact cause of this personality disorder is not well understood. However, a variety of factors may be


causative. According to the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (2006), this disorder is commonly associated with an early history of severe and repeated physical or sexual trauma. These individuals tend to be easily hypnotized and have the capacity for self-hypnosis. Their primary way of defending themselves is to dissociate.


Prior to treating dissociative personality disorder, it is imperative that a clinician first assess the individual for suicide risk, as individuals suffering from this disorder are prone to suicide. Psychoanalytic therapy is commonly used. Generally, treatment for this disorder is long term and relatively difficult.
Divided Self, The (Book)

The Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness, published in 1960, is a book written by psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Ronald D. Laing about people with psychotic disorders.

• Antipsychotic medications are prescription drugs used to treat psychotic disorders. They are sometimes referred to as antipsychotics or neuroleptics.
• Psychotic features are characteristics of psychotic disorders: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and speech, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and





negative symptoms, for example, lack of initiative and diminished emotional expression.
• Psychotic disorder is a severe mental disorder in which an individual loses touch with reality. Symptoms can include hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), delusions (fixed false beliefs that persist despite contrary evidence), and disordered thinking.
• Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that affects behavior, thinking, and emotion which make distinguishing between real and unreal experiences difficult. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, thought and communication disturbances, and withdrawal from others.


Scottish psychiatrist Ronald D. Laing (1927–1989) was one of the most prominent figures in the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s and 1970s. His observations led him to be very critical of the way the psychiatric community described and diagnosed insanity, especially in regard to schizophrenia. His critique called into question whether there is a clear diagnostic line between madness and sanity. In The Divided Self, Laing focuses specifically on schizophrenia. He claims that the disorder is largely an artificial creation of the psychiatric community that only served to label socially undesirable and misunderstood behavior. He questioned the value of antipsychotic drugs and argued that they were not the best or only treatment option for people with schizophrenia. He believed that the unreal world of schizophrenics was not simply a delusion. He described psychosis as the way that people with mental problems protect themselves from what they believe is threatening them.
Laing’s insights were very heavily influenced by
an existential approach to the observation of mental illness, based largely on the work of Jean Paul Sartre. His own psychological difficulties may have led him to see schizophrenia from the inside out, not just as an external observer. Laing established a therapeutic community near London to implement his ideas about how the mentally ill should be treated. In this


community, drugs, or antipsychotics, were not a part of the treatment regimen. He continued to try to find ways to appreciate and learn from the world of psychotic individuals while still helping them to live at peace with the rest of society.


Laing rose to prominence and fame quickly. He published a series of books and was criticized by the press because it believed his distinctions between the mentally ill and the sane were in many cases arbitrary, prejudiced, and potentially harmful. Partially because of







these criticisms and his own personal issues, his influence was short lived.
   In his later work, Laing argued that psychotic individuals were sometimes more sane than other people and that psychotic experiences could have a healing dimension. With these claims he undermined his credibility with the scientific community and alienated many who thought he had gone too far. At the same time he was engaging in his own interests such as eastern spirituality and other health areas like birthing techniques. This led him farther away from psychiatry. His abuse of alcohol, from which he died in 1989, was the cause of him losing his medical license.
   Recently, there has been a renewed interest in his ideas as society struggles with how to offer treatment to those suffering from psychosis. An effort to provide treatment while respecting clients’ rights, their experiences, and their dignity is important to many in the psychological community. Laing’s early work including The Divided Self is still used to challenge the health-care community to be honest and clear about treatment of psychosis in a mental health context. This important book reminds readers that caring for the mentally ill should not mean excluding them from society simply on the basis of a diagnosis or label.


Divorce is the dissolution or termination of a marital union.


More than one-half of all American first marriages end in divorce and over a million children a year are impacted by their parent’s marital breakup. The effects of divorce on children have been highly investigated by social researchers as they attempt to better understand how to help children adjust to the challenges related to divorce.
   Research indicates that children of divorce (COD) are more at risk for certain psychological problems when compared to children from continuously married parents (CCMP). Possible consequences include a decline in academic achievement, increases in anger, acting out or delinquent behaviors, higher rates of depression and anxiety, decrease in psychological well-being and self-esteem, decreased quality of family functioning, feelings of being caught between parents, and decreased coping capacity. Research also indicates that compared to CCMP, adult COD are at risk for lower self-esteem and less satisfaction with life, and have more symptoms of depression and anxiety. Adult COD also report less marital happiness, more marital discord, and more thoughts of divorce, and are more likely to get divorced.
Consequences of divorce should be viewed as risk
factors more so than predictions as the magnitude, or effect, of divorce is relatively moderate. Scientifically rigorous research has shown that 90% of COD reach adulthood with comparable levels of psychological well-being (levels of self-esteem, life satisfaction, happiness, and psychiatric symptoms) as CCMP. Although some children are more vulnerable and at greater risk than others, most COD adjust to divorce within a few years of the marital breakup.
   Researchers have identified two factors that particularly impact the effects of divorce on psychological well-being. COD who come from high marital discord families (e.g., yelling, screaming, and violence) actually have higher post-divorce well-being when compared to CCMP. This indicates that children exposed to high levels of conflict and discord may benefit from divorce. When parents reported low levels of discord, COD were worse off than CCMP. It may be that when parents outwardly get along a divorce is more shocking and difficult to adjust to for children. The other factor





Divorce, the legal dissolution or termination of a marital union, has become common in America and many other Western nations. Divorce can have a major psychological impact on everyone involved, particularly young children. 




that impacts the effect of divorce is the number of remarriages and re-divorce transitions of the parents. COD whose parents did not remarry had levels of psychological well-being comparable to that of CCMP. This suggests that the negative impact of divorce may be more associated with post-divorce remarriages.

Because of the prevalence of divorce and the large numbers of children impacted by it, a substantial body of research exist. There is an increase call for investigation into the buffering effects and resiliency factors in children. Current research continues on the development of after-school programs to assist COD, and further research into impact of remarriage is needed.





The Dodo bird verdict is the claim that all psychotherapies are equally effective regardless of their components.






• Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health disorders characterized by anxiety which tends to be intermittent instead of persistent. The group includes panic disorder, phobias, and generalized anxiety disorders.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as CBT.
• Common factors is the viewpoint that psychotherapy has common components or factors and that these effect change more than specific factors or techniques.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. Psychotherapy is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Therapeutic alliance is a helping relationship between a psychotherapist and an individual in which they work together to effect change for the individual seeking help.


The “Dodo bird verdict” is the name given to an ongoing debate in psychology. It is a controversial topic that claims that all psychotherapies produce equal outcomes regardless of their specific components. Psychologist Saul Rosenzweig (1907–2004) named the Dodo bird verdict in a 1936 article about common factors underlying competing approaches to psychotherapy. He argued that all therapy approaches were equally effective because of common factors. Rosenzweig used an illustration from Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) to describe the verdict. Several characters became wet and the Dodo bird has them run around the lake until they are dry. In time all get dry and he says, “Everyone has won, so all must have prizes.” Rosenzweig’s point is that common factors (e.g., everyone running around the lake) were more important than specific technical differences (e.g., how long or how far everyone had to run). He argued that all


therapies are winners; they all produce equally effective outcomes (e.g., everyone became dry in the end). In his 1975 review of psychotherapy research, psychologist Lester Luborsky (1920–2009) reported that there were few significant differences in the outcomes among the different psychotherapy approaches. Since then there have been several other studies that both support and oppose the verdict. Supporters of it claim that only common factors really effect change, particularly the therapeutic alliance. This is the means by

which a therapist and an individual engage with each other and effect positive change in the individual. According to supporters, the more positive the therapeutic alliance, the better chance of improvement, regardless of the techniques used.
   Critics of the Dodo bird verdict contend that specific techniques used in different therapies are more important and result in effective outcomes. Their most compelling argument is the research on cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders. CBT techniques are very effective in changing the individual’s maladaptive (faulty) thoughts and behavioral patterns. The change effected results in reduction of anxiety symptoms.



Domestic violence takes many forms and is known by many different names, including spousal abuse, intimate partner violence, domestic abuse, domestic battery, family violence, and dating abuse. It is defined as a pattern of behavior involving abuse by one partner against the other in a relationship where it is used to gain or maintain power or control over the other. This can include physical abuse, threats, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, patterns of control, intimidation, or


stalking. It can also involve endangerment of the other partner, such as kidnapping or harassment.


The abused partner is referred to as the victim or survivor. Using this terminology must come with caution as it must match the mind-set of the person. For instance, a person coming for therapy or assistance may react with strong negativity to specific terms, so it is important to use the appropriate terminology. Academically there is a push toward the term “survivor” as it is found to encompass the notion of empowerment and resiliency.
   Domestic violence encompasses a pattern of psychological, physical, emotional, economic, or sexual harm or threat of harm from one partner to another. This form of abuse can be a learned behavior or attitude of entitlement that can stem from a culturally supported environment. Those typically victim to this abuse are generally women and their children. However, it must be acknowledged that violence can occur in heterosexual and homosexual relationships, as well as with either a male or a female as the perpetrator or victim.
   Separating from a violent relationship is often complicated for the victim and can take months or even years. This can be connected to concerns over financial safety or over fear of being alone or experiencing further harm due to past threats. The abused partner may feel trapped and may also experience denial that it won’t happen again. The abused partner may also blame himself or herself for the acts of violence feeling he or she caused it by saying or acting in certain ways to upset his or her partner.
   In the 1970s, Lenore Walker identified the cycle of abuse. This theory helps to explain patterns of behavior in abusive relationships. The theory focuses on the notion that once an abusive relationship is established, it is characterized by predictable patterns of abuse. This concept has been widely used and accepted in the field of domestic violence programs, education, and advocacy programs.
   The cycle has four phases, and these repeat until the conflict has stopped generally by the victim or survivor leaving the relationship. The tension-building phase occurs prior to an abusive act and is generally

In addition to potential physical harm, domestic abuse can lead victims to feel anxious, depressed, fearful, and helpless. 


identified by poor communication, passive aggressive behavior, and tension between the partners as well as fear of causing an outburst. The abused partner may make attempts to modify his or her behavior at this point to try and avoid triggering his or her partner. The next phase is acting out, which is where there is an active abusive incident. Following this is the reconciliation or honeymoon phase, where the abuser apologizes, ignores the incident, or gives an overabundance of affection. There are promises that it will never happen again. The abuser may make statements of desire to harm himself or herself to gain sympathy from his or her partner. The fourth part to the cycle is the


calm phase where things seem to be peaceful. However, this will eventually lead back to difficulties and to the tension-building phase triggering the cycle to begin again.
   There are four major types of intimate partner violence that are supported by research. The first is common couple violence where it occurs in a single argument and one or both partners physically attack each other. Intimate terrorism involves emotional and psychological abuse.
   Violent resistance or self-defense occurs when the victim commits an act against the abusive partner. Finally, mutual violent control is a rare occurrence where both partners battle for control utilizing violent behaviors and actions.
   Incidents of domestic violence can turn deadly especially when the abused partner attempts to leave the relationship. In certain cultures “honor killings” occur when it is felt that a family member has “shamed” the family. For instance, in some Middle Eastern cultures women are to adhere to certain standards such as being accompanied by male family members. If the women were to act against this notion of honor (including leaving an abusive relationship), the family’s response to the perceived shame could result in that woman’s death.


Currently, one in every four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime. It is estimated that 85% of domestic violence victims are women. Females between the ages of 20 and 24 are currently at the greatest risk of intimate partner violence. There are over
18.5 million mental health visits made each year as a result of domestic violence. However, despite these large numbers, most cases are never reported to the police.







• Ventral tegmental area produces dopamine and signals to the nucleus accumbens and the rest of the striatum.


Dopamine is a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) in the brain that transmits nerve impulses that regulates attention, concentration, movement, impulse control, affect and mood, sleep, motivation, pleasure, and coping with stress. Pleasurable experiences are associated with high dopamine levels while stress is associated with lower levels. Altered levels of dopamine can cause a range of symptoms and problems, including depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), addictions, and schizophrenia. It also plays a prominent role in the manifestations of Parkinson’s disease.
   Dopamine is part of the dopamine family of neurotransmitters, which includes adrenaline and nor adrenaline. All are monoamines, which means that their
chemical structure includes an amino group linked with

Dopamine is a chemical messenger in the brain that regulates attention, affect, pleasure, and coping with stress. It is involved in disorders such as addictions, depression, and schizophrenia.


• Blood–brain barrier is a specialized layer of cells around the blood vessels of the brain controlling which substances can pass from the circulatory system into the brain.
• D1–D5 are the five dopamine receptor proteins responsible for receiving the dopamine transmission or signal for a cell.
• Mesolimbic pathway is the “reward path-way” of the brain.
• Nucleus accumbens is part of the brain involved in the mesolimbic reward pathway, which receives dopamine signaling from the ventral tegmental area.
• Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative nervous disease characterized by shuffling gain, tremors, and muscle stiffness.

an aromatic ring. Dopamine is made from the amino acid tyrosine (its precursor) in three brain areas: the substantia nigra, the ventral tegmentum, and the arcuate nucleus. The first two areas are implicated in many mental disorders. Because dopamine cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, medical professionals cannot just give dopamine directly. Instead, they give its precursor, tyrosine, which can cross the barrier so that the brain can make dopamine on its own. There are five dopamine receptors (D1–D5) which recognize the dopamine molecule, bind to it, and transmit its signal to other cells.
   A decline in dopamine (D2 receptors in the substantia nigra) is linked with Parkinson’s disease. Low levels of dopamine can also result in symptoms of depression, such as a loss of pleasure or motivation. Low levels of dopamine binding to other D2 receptor are associated with social anxiety, while high levels are linked to the hypersocial behavior of those experiencing the manic phase of bipolar disorder. ADHD is also associated with problems in dopamine transmission.
   In contrast, schizophrenia is linked with high dopamine levels (in the ventral tegmentum) and the symptoms of hallucinations and disturbed thinking. Interestingly, those with Parkinson’s disease who take medication that raises dopamine levels too high can develop





symptoms of schizophrenia, while those with schizophrenia who take medication that lowers dopamine levels can experience symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

Side effects from medications that act on dopamine have been reported. More common ones are nausea, vomiting, and headache. Less common are irregular or rapid heartbeat, chest pain, dizziness, and trouble breathing.
   Medications act on various dopamine receptors and increase or decrease dopamine levels. L-dopa is medication (antiparkinsonian) used in treating Parkinson’s disease. It is a dopamine precursor that is synthesized into dopamine in the brain and reverses the effects of low dopamine levels. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) block the activity of the enzyme that breaks down dopamine. As a result, MAOIs like Nardil and Parnate are antidepressants that increase dopamine levels. Antipsychotics are divided into two classes: typical and atypical antipsychotics that target different types of dopamine receptors. Clozaril is an atypical antipsychotic that targets the D4 receptor more strongly than the D2 receptor, while Parlodel targets D2 and is a partial inhibitor of D1. Abilify is a partial dopamine agonist (mimic), and Symmetrel is also a dopamine agonist.



Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that results in impairments of mental and physical development.


Down syndrome (DS) is the most commonly occurring chromosomal condition in which children exhibit atypical physical features such as upward slanted eyes, small stature, and a deep crease in the palm of the hands. Although he was not the first to describe it, the syndrome was named after Dr. John Langdon Down, who published a detailed analysis of the condition in 1866. People with Down syndrome demonstrate a range of physical and mental impairments. According to the Centers for Disease Control, approximately 1 out of 691 children born in the United States is diagnosed with Down syndrome. Many people with DS have an intellectual deficit, or mental retardation, on a range from mild to severe. According to the National Down Syndrome Society, the average IQ score of a young adult with DS is approximately 50 while the national average is 100.
   Through genetic testing, it is possible to identify Down syndrome at birth or before birth through prenatal testing such as amniocentesis. Prenatal testing can often lead to a decision on the part of the parents to terminate the pregnancy. The ability to identify the syndrome prenatally and terminate pregnancy is a controversial issue among the DS community.


Down syndrome is the most common chromosome abnormality in humans. Typically, human beings have cells that contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, half from each parent. When a person’s cells show the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21, he or she has DS.
   People with Down syndrome can be recognized due to certain abnormal physical characteristics. These include a short and wide physique, weak muscles, an upward slant to the eyes, and a deep crease across the center of the palm. These physical features vary from person to person. Individuals with DS can also experience conditions such as heart disease, celiac disease, and orthopedic conditions, which require medical supervision and care.
   In childhood it is typical for individuals with Down syndrome to have a delay in speech development.





People with DS often demonstrate some degree of mental retardation. Often fine motor skills are also slow to develop. The development of gross motor skills affects some children who might not master walking until the age of four years.

Genetic testing allows physicians to diagnose Down syndrome prenatally and at birth. Down syndrome is diagnosed through genetic tests that identify an extra copy of chromosome 21. Due to prenatal testing, many pregnancies end in early termination.
   Decades ago the life expectancy for those with DS was nine years old. Over the last several decades, medical and educational interventions have substantially increased the prognosis for people with DS. Today people with DS typically live to 50 years of age or more.
   People with Down syndrome have an elevated risk of developing several medical conditions. Commonly occurring medical diagnosis include heart disease, immune system problems, and seizure disorders. Complications with DS and these conditions increase the risk of premature death for these individuals. Regular checkups with a physician are highly recommended for people with DS.


Treatment for Down syndrome is based on an analysis of each person’s physical and intellectual challenges. Early childhood intervention through therapy and educational program is proven most effective. Preschool programs for children with Down syndrome will typically address all aspects of physical, occupational and speech therapies.
   It is not only early childhood interventions and education which help. Also important is continued screening for physical and psychological issues that could affect life expectancy. Seeking appropriate medical treatment is important. In addition to medical interventions, it is helpful for people with Down syndrome to live in a supportive family or residential environment. The opportunity for vocational training can add immeasurably to the productivity, length, and quality of life for people with DS.


   In the past, children with Down syndrome often received only basic, home-based education. Currently many DS children are integrated into the regular educational curriculum. For those who are not placed in regular education, specialized educational opportunities are available. Some students with DS graduate from high school and some go to college.
   It has been found that education and opportunities to learn increase independence and self-care and improve quality of life. In the United States, there are increasing opportunities for participating in postsecondary education. Many adults with Down syndrome are able to work in the community, while others require a more sheltered work environment.

Dreams can range from the absurd and disjointed to exciting or even terrifying. But figuring out what dreams mean is often subject to intense debate. Still, the interpretation of dreams has long been used in therapy for promoting personal change. It is defined as the process of assigning meaning to dreams and is used broadly across many theoretical orientations. It is a therapeutic approach that offers considerable flexibility in integrating theory and techniques to interpret a client’s dreams.
   Dream interpretation is thought to offer insight into a person’s innermost longings, ability to problem solve, ability to adapt, and overall approach to creative





self-expression. Many believe that the content of a person’s dreams is directly correlated to his or her waking life, as well as the level of psychological functioning. Dreams offer a therapist insightful information about a client’s personality traits, as well as potential clinical challenges.
   Sigmund Freud, who wrote The Interpretation of Dreams, was among the first to show a strong interest in interpreting the dreams of his patients. He suggested that dreams were related to wish fulfillment. He also believed that the content of the dream is connected to the unconscious wishes of the dreamer.
   Freud identified four elements to dream interpretation, which he referred to as “dream work.” The four elements include condensation, displacement, symbolization, and secondary revision. Condensation represents the multitude of ideas and concepts that are represented in a single dream and the information is condensed into a single thought or image. Displacement is the element that disguises the emotional meaning of the content. Symbolization censors the repressed ideas contained in the dream by including objects that are symbols of the content. Secondary revision is the final stage of the process. Freud suggested that strange elements are reorganized to make the dream understandable.
   Carl Jung agreed with some points made by Freud. However, Jung did not share Freud’s view that dreams are an expression of wish fulfillment. Jung instead believed that dreams were a way of revealing the personal and collective unconscious. He suggested that dreams were a way of compensating for less developed aspects of a person’s psyche. Later research showed that personality that a person possesses in waking life is the same or similar to those expressed in dreams.
   Dream interpretation as part of therapy is approached in a four-step process. It starts by reviewing all the images that were part of the dream. The client narrates the dream completely prior to the therapist asking any questions. The next step includes the therapist asking clarifying questions about the dream, including the client’s affect, what the client saw, heard, or touched. Mining for this type of information helps uncover the feelings and sensations that were part of the dream. The third step attempts to revive the dream and the associate feelings by placing the client in a relaxed state. The therapist then helps the client relive the


experiences of his or her dream. The key of this third step is to narrow in on any images that were particularly vivid for the dreamer. The fourth and final stage of dream interpretation has the therapist linking the experiences of the dream to other areas of the client’s life and then integrating the experiences with the client’s history and present life experiences.
   Dream interpretation, however, lacks a unified and established methodology. The science and scientific support of dream interpretation is lacking. For instance, if one were to search what dreaming of fire means, one source indicates it represents a cleansing or punishment, whereas another source says it is connected with anger or a new beginning. While there are some similarities, these ideas are vague and differ enough that there is conflicting support of the meaning of this dream.
   Dream interpretation has grown in popularity since the 1970s. Today, many bookstores have a wide collection of books available about the meaning of dreams, including dream dictionaries, symbol guides, and tips for interpreting and understanding dreams. However, the popularity tends to be more with the general public than with researchers in the mental health field. In fact, some researchers feel that dream interpretation is a neglected technique in contemporary treatment; however, others argue that there is not enough evidence to support using this as a treatment modality.





Rudolf Dreikurs, MD, was an American psychiatrist and educator known for advancing Adlerian psychology through his writings and professional publications.



Rudolf Dreikurs, MD (1897–1972), was an American psychiatrist and educator who advanced the theory and practice of Adlerian psychology, created by Alfred Adler (1870–1937). This approach to psychology understands individuals as social beings with a need to belong and strive for significance. It is also known as Individual Psychology. Dreikurs was a student and eventually close colleague of Alfred Adler. After Adler’s death in 1937, Dreikurs went on to promote the use of Individual Psychology around the world.
   Among his many contributions to the theory of Individual Psychology, he described a model of misbehavior and suggested that children “act out” when they experience a lack of belonging to a particular group or in their family. When a child misbehaves, he or she is acting from one of four “mistaken goals”: attention seeking, power, revenge, or assumed inadequacy. Attention seeking is when a child keeps others busy through various behaviors to seek attention. The power goal is when a child seeks power to feel in control and a sense of belonging. The revenge goal is when a child seeks to get even or to retaliate for a previously perceived wrong doing of another person. The assumed inadequacy goal is when a child gives up to be left alone so that others will expect little from the child. Dreikurs worked with children by helping them enhance their cooperation and belonging skills by empowering them feel that they are valuable contributors to a classroom or family.
In 1952, Dreikurs founded the North American Society of Adlerian Psychology, of which he was an active leader of the society up until his death in 1972. He wrote many books that expanded the theory and practice of Adlerian psychology. He also founded the Alfred Adler Institute in 1952, which is now called Adler University, in Chicago, Illinois.






Drug culture is a description for those people, groups, or communities where the use of drugs is a key element of daily life and social relationships.


• Alcohol use disorder is a mental disorder involving a pattern of alcohol use which leads to significant problems for the user.
• Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that slow the nervous system and are prescribed to relieve nervousness and tension, to induce sleep, and to treat other symptoms. They are highly addictive.
• Opioids are a group of drugs that reduce pain. They are highly addictive and include both prescription drugs like Percocet and illegal drugs like heroin.
• Psychoactive is a drug or substance that has a significant effect on mental processes. There are five groups of psychoactive drugs: opioids, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and cannabis.
• Psychotropic medications are prescribed drugs that affect thinking, feeling, and behavior. They include antipsychotic, antianxiety, antidepressant, and antimanic medications.





• Stimulant is a drug that increases brain activity and produces a sense of alertness, euphoria, endurance, and productivity, or suppresses appetite. Examples are cocaine, amphetamines, and Ritalin.
• Substance abuse involves the use of substances (drugs or alcohol) in amounts or with methods that are harmful.

Drugs, which can be defined as behavior-altering chemicals, have played a part in the history of most civilizations. There are several kinds of drugs, including alcohol, stimulants, opioids, benzodiazepines, cannabis, and psychoactives. Over time drugs have been used as parts of religious rituals, as well as for medicinal purposes and entertainment, escape, or recreation.
   Culture can be defined as learned behavior based on a combination of shared customs, language, and beliefs. Subcultures share traits with the dominant culture but distinguish themselves with different customs, ideas, and practices. Some subcultures form as a result of a positive response to problems in the larger culture, and some are negative reactions against the values of the dominant culture. The drug culture can be viewed as a result of both negative and positive responses to the issues in the larger culture.
   Drug cultures are examples of subcultures built around the idea that drugs, especially illegal drugs, are an important part of the human experience. Drug cultures are often associated with other sociological minority classifications such as race, poverty, or youth. Since society at large ostracizes and punishes the use of illegal drugs, the basis for conflict between the larger society and the drug culture is inevitable.


Drugs cause internal chemical changes in the body whether the intention of their use is medically beneficial or recreationally damaging. The dilemma that society and the medical community face is how to draw a sensible line between medically beneficial and


dangerous drugs. In addition to this issue, many people are concerned about the overuse and dependence both of medically beneficial and of dangerous drugs for those who use them.
   Not all drugs are illegal. Legal drugs include alcohol, prescription medications, and some mood-altering drugs depending on location. In the United States approximately two-thirds of the population drink alcohol. It is worth noting that for a decade in the 1920s, America tried to outlaw alcohol as an illegal drug during a period called prohibition. Prohibition had negative social and legal implications but was an attempt to prohibit the use of this addictive substance.
   Another legal drug is nicotine. About 20% of people in the United States report using nicotine regularly, and it is a highly addictive drug. Other highly addictive drugs that people are dependent on are legally prescribed medications traditionally used to treat disorders such as depression or anxiety. The variety of mood-altering drugs that are available from multiple sources grows each year. The demand in the market for these products, distributed both legally and illegally, contributes to this growth.
   Even though legal drugs cause both social and health problems, the appeal of the drug culture has always been illegal drugs. It is estimated that about 10% of people in the United States use illegal drugs regularly and many more have experimented with them at some point in their lives. It is estimated that millions of Americans are dependent on the use of illegal drugs such as heroin and cocaine.
   Perhaps nothing illustrates the mystique surrounding illegal drugs better than two famous works of art. The first is a novel and later film written by Hunter
S. Thompson in 1971, called Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The film’s subtitle is A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream and gave the sense of the love/hate relationship that Americans have with illegal drugs and the glamorization of their role. Another, more recent portrayal of drug culture is the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street. In this film, the presence of illegal drugs highlights the drug culture of the wealthy and successful. The use of high-class drugs and partying was a large part of the financial and social status of the characters in this film and is





a reflection of the drug culture for the rich during the 1980s and beyond.
   The government and society in general are unsure of how to handle drugs and the drug culture. It seems clear that the issue is important, but it does not seem to have a simple solution. Legalization or decriminalization of drug use is gaining government clearance for substances such as cannabis in many locations across the globe. But some have cited both health and moral problems with the legalization of formerly illegal drugs. It is reported that as many as 25% of adolescents, between the ages of 16 and 17, are estimated to have used marijuana. The use of medical and recreational marijuana was first made legal in states like California, Colorado, and Washington. Many expect that this trend will grow, with more states legalizing its use.
   Drug campaigns, such as the “Just Say No” approach of the 1980s, have not been effective in reducing the use of drugs or formation of drug subcultures. Many issues still exist, such as how to distinguish between medical and recreational use of drugs or decriminalizing possession of drugs for private use. Prevention programs such as improving substance abuse education and treatments have been in place for decades with varied impact. The drug culture is in frequent conflict with policy makers and authorities, like the Drug Enforcement Authority. Despite efforts to eradicate legal and illegal drug use and abuse, drug cultures persist and provide opportunities for those who engage or believe in the use of personal or medical drug use.

Drug dependence is a mental condition characterized by physical dependence. It is similar to but different from addiction.

• Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain which involves compulsive and uncontrolled pursuit of reward or relief with substance use or other compulsive behaviors.
• Alcohol use disorder is a mental disorder involving a pattern of alcohol use which leads to significant problems for the user.
• Cannabis use disorder is a mental disorder characterized by cannabis (marijuana) use which leads to significant problems for the user.
• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Physical dependence refers to physical changes in the body that result in tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when drug use is discontinued.
• Psychological dependence refers to the loss of control over the intense urges to use a substance at the expense of adverse (harmful) consequences.
• Stimulant use disorder is a mental disorder that is characterized by the use of stimulants, which leads to significant problems for the user. It includes amphetamine and cocaine.
• Substance-related and addictive disorders are a group of mental disorders that include substance disorders characterized by physiological dependence, drug-seeking behavior, tolerance, and social withdrawal. This group also includes the non-substance disorder of gambling.





• Tolerance is the phenomenon in which the body requires increased amounts of the substance to achieve the desired effect.
• Withdrawal is the unpleasant and potentially life-threatening physiological changes that occur due to the discontinuation of certain drugs after prolonged regular use.



Drug dependence is a mental condition characterized by the symptoms of physical dependence (tolerance and withdrawal) following the use of a drug or alcohol. In everyday language, the term “drug dependence” is used interchangeably with addiction. While both share some common features, there are also significant differences. Their technical meaning tends to differentiate them. For instance, the term “dependence” is used by many researchers and professionals to describe physical dependence following use of drugs or alcohol. Physical dependence is also observed with certain prescribed medications, such as antidepressants. On the other hand, addiction is characterized by psychological dependence, although there may also be some physical dependence. However, the physical changes associated with drug withdrawal are distinct from the loss of control over the intense urges that is associated with addiction. In short, psychological dependence refers to impaired control over drinking or drug


   However, DSM-5 does describe several substance-related and addictive disorders. These include alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and stimulant use disorder. To make such diagnoses, it must be evident that there is impaired control over the use of the substance or addictive behavior and that it significantly disrupts the lives of the user. Currently, the causes of these disorders are not well understood. However, there are probably multiple causative factors. These may include biological or genetic history, psychological traits and coping skills, and environmental factors such as parent’s use of substances and peer influence.

use, while physical dependence refers to tolerance and		
withdrawal symptoms.

   Until recently, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has added to the confusion by its inconsistent use of the terms “addiction” and “dependence” to describe alcohol and drug problems. DSM-5 resolved that confusion by eliminating the category of drug (substance) dependence entirely. Now, the compulsive drug-seeking behavior of addiction is differentiated from the normal responses of tolerance and withdrawal experienced by some when using prescribed medications. While drug (substance) dependence had been considered a mental disorder in previous editions of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), it is no longer considered a disorder in DSM-5.

The Drug Enforcement Administration is a federal law enforcement agency that enforces controlled substances laws and regulations. It is also called the DEA.


• Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that slow the nervous system and are prescribed to relieve nervousness and tension, to induce sleep, and to treat other symptoms. They are highly addictive.
• Controlled substances are a drug or chemical whose use, manufacture, and possession laws are regulated by the federal government.





These can be illegal substances or prescription medication.
• Controlled Substances Act was passed into law in 1973 to regulate the importation, manufacture, possession, and use of certain substances.
• Illicit drugs are illegal drugs that have no medical use and are often used for their ability to distort an individual’s mental process.
• Opioids are a group of drugs that reduce pain. They are highly addictive and include both prescription drugs like Percocet and illegal drugs like heroin.
• Psychoactive is a drug or substance that has a significant effect on mental processes. There are five groups of psychoactive drugs: opioids, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and cannabis.
• Psychotropic medications are prescribed drugs that affect thinking, feeling, and behavior. They include antipsychotic, antianxiety, antidepressant, and antimanic medications.
• War on Drugs refers to the national campaign against drug abuse, which was popularized during the early 1970s following a speech by President Richard Nixon in which he publicly declared drug abuse as “public enemy number one.”


The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice that enforces controlled substances laws and regulations. Its goal is to reduce illegal drug use and drug trafficking in the United States. The DEA enforces the Controlled Substances Act. It regulates and monitors the growing, manufacture, and distribution of controlled substances and illicit substances. Controlled substances are often abused and used for nonmedical purposes. Psychotropic medications such as opioids and benzodiazepines have medical purposes, but they are also used for nonmedical purposes. Many


psychoactive substances have medical purposes, but many psychoactive substances are used by individuals to experience the “high.”
   In response to increasing drug trade and related crimes, President Richard Nixon declared an all-out global war on the drug menace. It became known as the War on Drugs. The Drug Enforcement Administration was initiated on July 1, 1973, and signed into effect by President Richard Nixon. The DEA is led by an Administrator of Drug Enforcement, who is appointed by the president of the United States. The creation of this federal agency was to prevent illicit drug trafficking based on the growing concerns about the availability of drugs in the United States.


Though the DEA began with just 1,470 special agents and a budget of less than $75 million, the agency has grown considerably now, staffing some 5,000 agents and operating on a budget of over $2 billion. Over the past several decades the agency has improved its operations and influence by adding new divisions and incorporating advancements in technology. DEA efforts have increased in recent years in response to the drastic rise in oxycodone, Xanax, and other prescription drugs resulting from the pill mill and pain clinic epidemics. Efforts have also focused on black market drugs, including crack cocaine, heroine, Ecstasy, and steroids. Most recently, the DEA has been in the middle of the national controversy over the possible legalization of medical marijuana.








Dual diagnosis is the co-occurrence of a mental disorder and a substance-related disorder.


• Biopsychosocial refers to the interrelationship of biological, psychological, and social factors.
• Co-occurrence means that two things are happening at the same time.
• Comorbid refers to the occurrence of two or more disorders in the same person that can start at the same time or one after the other.
• DSM-5 is the abbreviation for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders.
• Motivational interviewing is a five-stage model used by clinicians to help clients with substance abuse problems become motivated to change. The five stages are pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.
• Substance-related disorders are a class of DSM-5 disorders characterized by the use of one or more substances that lead to significant distress or disruption of daily life. Alcohol and


cannabis (marijuana) are examples of these disorders.


Dual diagnosis is the co-occurrence of a mental disorder and a substance disorder. Either disorder can occur first, but one does not necessarily cause the other. Both mental and substance disorders are influenced by biopsychosocial factors. Genetic factors play a role in an individual’s susceptibility to both. Substance use may result in the expression of symptoms in individuals predisposed to a mental disorder. From a psychological standpoint, it may be that those with a mental disorder use substances to make themselves feel better. Environmental factors such as physical, emotional, and sexual abuse can also play a role. When an individual begins using drugs, this drug use may change brain functioning in a manner that increases the possibility of a disorder.
   The term “dual diagnosis” was originally used by researchers and practitioners during the mid-1980s. During this time, several initiatives began the integration of mental health and substance abuse services to overcome the problems associated with single treatment efforts. Traditionally, patients with co-occurring disorders received mental health care and substance abuse services from two different practitioners in two different locations. This sequential treatment approach made it difficult for patients to receive comprehensive care, to access care, and to integrate information from different practitioners.
   A dual diagnosis is correlated with multiple problems such as relapse, frequent hospitalization, depression, suicidality, imprisonment, homelessness, and interpersonal difficulties. Individuals with dual diagnoses have higher rates of symptoms, hospitalization, housing problems, and dysfunction than individuals diagnosed with a single disorder. Furthermore, treatment costs are higher among people with dual diagnoses compared to those with a single diagnosis. Those with comorbid disorders are more susceptible to dropping out of outpatient treatment and are frequent users of hospital and emergency services. To increase treatment outcomes, dual diagnosis treatment facilities integrate mental health interventions and substance





abuse interventions within one program. Interventions for both mental illness and substance abuse require long-term efforts that work to stabilize, educate, and promote self-management. A team approach of mental health and substance treatment practitioners working together can greatly improve care and reduce treatment costs. Comprehensive treatment programs offer individual, group, and family counseling; psychiatric services; medication monitoring; psychoeducation; case management; and outreach services. Individuals with mental disorder are frequently unaware that they have a substance abuse problem and may not be motivated to seek treatment. Motivational interviewing is useful to help individuals gain awareness, develop motivation, and elicit behavior change. Unless treatment is successful, the presence of dual diagnosis greatly reduces individuals’ ability to live within and contribute to their community.
Dyslexia

Dyslexia is the impairment that affects a person’s ability to read written language with the speed and ability of others.

Dyslexia is another term for specific learning disorder for people who have trouble with reading. Some


researchers suggest that 15% of the general population have dyslexia. The diagnosis is not related to intelligence, vision, or other learning disorders. It is estimated that 80% of all individuals diagnosed with learning disorders have a form of dyslexia.
   Dyslexia impairs an individual’s ability to easily recognize and understand written information. Even though reading is a challenge for these people, some with dyslexia experience an increase in their thinking and visualization abilities. Although most children with dyslexia are identified when they go to school, there are some whose condition is not fully diagnosed until adulthood. Identifying it can be complicated because children with the diagnosis have normal vision and intelligence.


Although difficulties with reading can arise from different sources, dyslexia is distinct since it is caused by neurological deficits. This means that there are similar brain differences among those with dyslexia. Researchers have identified that these differences are usually located in the temporal processing center of the brain.
   There are many common symptoms of dyslexia. Symptoms include delayed letter recognition and difficulty in rhyming and listing words that begin with the same sound. These children can also be slow to learn letter sounds and read slowly. Often the recognition of words is affected and therefore the child can be reluctant to read. If a child exhibits one or more of these symptoms, it does not necessarily mean that the child has dyslexia. A thorough evaluation is needed to determine if a child has dyslexia and not some other problem which leads to difficulties in reading.
   Although dyslexia mainly affects a person’s ability to read and understand information, it can also impair language expression. It can also be linked to and complicated by other disorders, such as attention-deficit disorder and mathematics disorder. Dyslexia and IQ are not related since intelligence develops separately from reading.

The diagnosis of dyslexia is now officially called specified learning disorder, with deficiency in reading. In





order to qualify for this diagnosis, a person is required to have trouble with identifying and understanding written words. This can include problems such as poor fluid reading and frequent spelling mistakes. Dyslexia is usually recognized during the early years of school as children struggle to learn to read. People with dyslexia can learn to read with good comprehension, but it generally takes them longer to read than others. They may also perform more slowly at related tasks such as spelling and sorting words.

In order to help people with dyslexia with their reading difficulties, different supports can be put into place. Therapy and educational supports aim at helping children work through visual and auditory processing of words. Usually these supports are most effective when used in childhood while the brain is still developing. It is important to note that there is no cure for dyslexia. It’s a lifelong condition caused by inherited traits that affect how your brain works. However, most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role in helping people adjust to the difficulties they experience. The use of relaxation and anxiety-reducing strategies benefits people with dyslexia, who experience stress as a result of the disorder.



Dyspareunia is a mental disorder characterized by genital pain during sexual intercourse.


• Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
• DSM stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria. The current edition is DSM-5.
• Exposure is a cognitive behavior therapy intervention (method) in which an individual is exposed to a feared object or situation. It is also referred to as flooding.
• Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is a mental disorder in women characterized by persistent fear, pain, or difficulty with vaginal intercourse. Previously this disorder was referred to as dyspareunia and vaginismus.
• Pelvic floor muscle training involves a series of exercises designed to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor. These exercises are used to treat problems with urine leakage, bowel control, and pelvic pain.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapy or therapeutic counseling.
• Sexual dysfunctions disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant difficulty in responding sexually or experiencing sexual pleasure. They include delayed ejaculation, female organismic disorder, and genito-pelvic pain penetration disorder.
• Systematic desensitization is form of cognitive behavior therapy that gradually exposes individuals to their phobia (fear) while remaining calm and relaxed.
• Vaginismus is the inability to allow vaginal penetration because of anxiety and fear of pain that results in vaginal spasm.






Dyspareunia was a sexual disorder in DSM-IV-TR but is not listed as such in DSM-5. It is characterized by genital pain during sexual intercourse. This pain is experienced during intercourse, but for some, it may be experienced either before or after. While it is experienced in males and females, it is more common in females. This disorder has been combined with vaginismus in the current DSM-5 in the diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. These two disorders were combined in DSM-5 because it was difficult for clinicians to distinguish between these two disorders and because they commonly occurred together.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, an individual may be diagnosed with this disorder if he or she experiences repeated pain accompanying intercourse. As with most mental disorders, these symptoms must cause the individual distress. The pain cannot be better explained by an alternative cause such as a lack of lubrication, medical condition, or substance use. This disorder may be present for an individual’s entire life, or it may begin after a period of normal sexual functioning. Symptoms may occur in a particular circumstance or in all situations involving intercourse (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). The cause of this disorder is unclear. It is believed that sexual abuse, body-image issues, relationship issues, religious beliefs, and a history of vaginal infection may contribute to the manifestation of this disorder. However, for the majority of individuals, a combination of psychological, physiological, and social factors are likely to be present. For this reason, it is important for a clinician to be diligent in his or her
assessment of this disorder.


Treatment includes a comprehensive medical evaluation to identify any medical condition that might cause dyspareunia. If one is found, then medical treatment is appropriate. If no such cause is identified, it is usually treated with a combination of physical therapy and psychotherapy. Physical therapy is necessary to help the individual learn how to train and control pelvic floor muscles. The most common form of psychotherapy for this disorder is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT is used to reduce fear, anxiety, and pain. It emphasizes systematic desensitization and exposure techniques. If trauma issues are involved, it would also address them or refer for specialized treatment.













Early recollections is a personality test that analyzes single-incident memories from childhood.


• Adlerian therapy is a psychotherapy approach developed by Alfred Adler that emphasizes the individual’s life style. Connectedness with others (belonging), meeting the life tasks, and contributions to society (social interest) are considered the hallmarks of mental health.
• Inferiority complex is a behavioral manifestation of a subjective feeling of inferiority.
• Inferiority feeling is the emotional reaction to a self-appraisal of deficiency that is subjective, global, and judgmental.
• Life style refers to one’s attitudes and convictions about belonging and finding a place in the world.
• Life style convictions are the attitudes and beliefs that direct an individual’s sense of belonging.
• Life tasks are the main challenges (work, love, and friendship) that life presents to all individuals.
• Private logic are convictions that run counter to social interest and fail to foster a constructive sense of belonging with others.
• Projective technique is a psychological test in which an individual’s responses to ambiguous


stimuli like are analyzed to determine underlying personality traits, feelings, or attitudes.
• Safeguarding mechanisms are the behaviors of attitudes that individuals select to evade responsibility and not meet the life tasks. Safeguarding mechanisms are called defense mechanism by other approaches.
• Social interest refers to the behaviors and attitudes that display an individual’s sense of belonging, concern for, and contributions to the community.


Early recollections (ERs) are a projective technique in which early memories are used to identify an individual’s life style convictions and other personality dynamics. Research indicates that memories are not identical simulations of the past but are stories shaped by one’s current view of others, the world, and ourselves. As a result, the gathering of ERs can be used as a projective technique that indicates one’s strengths, goals, lines of movement, fears, worries, and other relevant psychological data. ERs provide a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective personality assessment that has similar reliability and validity to other personality tests. ERs are typically elicited by a counselor or psychotherapist both to assess the client’s life style convictions and personality and to monitor change in the course of therapy.


Alfred Adler (1870–1937) was a Viennese physician who developed Adlerian therapy. In his earliest








writings, he emphasized the clinical value of understanding the individual’s life story. Adler viewed it as the story that an individual repeats to himself or herself to warn or to comfort himself or herself. It helps the individual focus on his or her goals. Based on past experiences, this story prepares the individual to meet the future with a ready-made, already-tested style of action. Adler called this story or narrative the “life style.” It is important to distinguish life style from the contemporary uses of the word “lifestyle” as in “lifestyles of the rich and famous.” Life style and its related life style convictions specify the individual’s subjective view of oneself, others, and the world.
   An individual’s life style develops based on childhood experiences and perceptions of those experiences. ERs are those single incidents from childhood in which the individual reconstitutes in present experience as mental pictures or as focused sensory memories. They are understood dynamically; that is, the act of recollecting and re-remembering is a present activity. Historical accuracy is of no concern with these recollections. Rather, ERs, as understood in Adlerian therapy, mirror presently held convictions, evaluations, attitudes, and biases. In such memories, the level of activity or passivity of an individual is very likely to predict how the individual will respond to present and future circumstances. For example, in a series of memories, an individual who passively accepts unfavorable circumstances in his or her memories is likely to respond in a similar passive way in present life situations. In contrast, an individual who acts to improve circumstances in a series of memories is likely to respond in an active way in present life situations.
Individuals develop four life style convictions:
a self-view the convictions one has about who one is; a self-ideal the convictions of what one should be or are obliged to be to have a place; a world view one’s picture of the world or convictions about the not self and what the world demands of the individual; and one’s ethical convictions—a personal moral code. When there is conflict between the self-concept and the ideal, inferiority feelings develop. It is important to note feelings of inferiority are not considered abnormal. However, when the individual begins to act inferior rather than feel


inferior, the individual expresses an “inferiority complex.” Thus, while the inferiority feeling is universal and normal, the inferiority complex reflects the discouragement of a limited segment of our society and is usually abnormal.
   One of the main tools Adlerian therapists use to assess how an individual is functioning is a life style assessment. The goal of the life style assessment is to explore the individual’s perceptions of his or her childhood experiences to discover the influence those perceptions have on the individual’s current functioning. Basic to life style assessment is the elicitation of ERs.
   The basic technique of eliciting ERs begins by asking the individual to think back before the age of 10 and to verbally share the earliest memory that comes to mind. It is essential that the focuses are on experiences occurring before the age of 10. Ten years is considered the age at which a child develops the ability to record events in chronological sequence. Then, the individual is asked to describe the memory as if it were a video recording with a beginning, middle, and end, and that has a feeling associated with it. The therapist writes down the memory using as many of the individual’s words as possible. Then, the therapist asks the individual to freeze a certain scene or frame of the most vivid part of that memory and describe that frame. The individual is then asked to indicate his or her feeling or feelings about that vivid scene. Next, the individual is asked to indicate his or her thought or thoughts about that vivid scene.
   Usually a minimum of three ERs are collected. From these, the therapist looks for themes. These themes usually offer valuable insight into the individual’s presenting problem or concern. There are many ways to interpret themes from ERs. One way of interpretation is to notice who is and who is not included in the ERs, who else may be present in the ERs, and the extent of details that are included and what is emphasized. Overall, ERs provide a quick, accurate, and clinically useful assessment of an individual’s personality dynamics, particularly life style convictions.




FEDs have serious health consequences and are potentially life threatening. Anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating are the most commonly known FEDs but are not the only FEDs listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).


Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss. Approximately 90%–95% of people diagnosed with anorexia are females. Symptoms include low body weight, inadequate food intake to maintain weight, an extreme fear of gaining weight

		or becoming overweight, disturbed perceptions of

Eating and feeding disorders are a group of extreme and potentially life-threatening beliefs, feelings, and behaviors about personal weight and food consumption.


• Binge eating or bingeing is an out-of-control eating episode in which an abnormally large amount of food is ingested in a short period of time.
• Compensatory behaviors include self-induced vomiting, use of laxative or diuretics, fasting, and excessive exercise.
• Diuretics are substances that elevate the rate of urination and water loss.
• Laxatives are drugs, medications, or substances that stimulate the evacuation of the bowels.
• Low weight is weight that is less than minimally expected for age and height.
• Purging is to clear the stomach and/or the intestines of material by the use of laxatives, diuretics, or self-induced vomiting.


Feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) are a group of psychological disorders characterized by impaired eating habits and abnormal perception of one’s weight.

body image, and an inability to recognize the seriousness of the behaviors. People suffering from anorexia are overly preoccupied with weight, food, fat and calorie intake, and dieting. Sufferers often develop food rituals such as arranging food on their plate or eating foods only in a specific order. They may make excuses to avoid mealtimes or situations where food may be consumed and make frequent reference to feeling fat or overweight. In spite of extreme thinness, sufferers perceive themselves as overweight. Self-starvation is the essential component of anorexia and as such has significant and serious health consequences, including muscle loss, reduced bone density, severe dehydration, kidney failure, weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, loss of hair, loss of menstrual cycle, and death. Anorexia is one of the most lethal mental health disorders, with 5%–20% of people suffering with anorexia dying from complications associated with starvation.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is similar to anorexia, but food aversion is not related to a disturbance of body image. Food is avoided for a variety of reasons such as lack of interest in eating; dislike or aversion to certain food characteristics such as the smell, color, or texture; and fear of negative consequences of eating, such as choking or vomiting. Avoidant/restrictive food disorder is more prevalent in children than in adults and is equally common in males and females.
   Bulimia nervosa is characterized by a sense of out-of-control binge eating and engaging in excessive behaviors in order to compensate for the amount





of food ingested. Compensatory behaviors include self-induced vomiting, abuse of laxatives or diuretics, excessive and extreme exercise. Health consequences include damage to the digestive system; dehydration and electrolyte imbalances; inflammation and damage to the esophagus from frequent vomiting; tooth decay from stomach acids; and in rare cases stomach rupture. Approximately 1%–2% of the U.S. population suffers from bulimia, with 80% being female.
   Binge eating disorder is similar to bulimia, but individuals do not engage in the compensatory behaviors associated with bulimia. Symptoms include a sense of out-of-control eating, eating alone due to shame, feelings of guilt, and shame over binging. Health consequences are less severe than bulimia and include high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and weight gain. Approximately 1%–5% of the population suffers from binge eating disorder, with 60% being female.
   Other eating disorders recognized in the DSM-5 include pica disorder, which is characterized by eating of nonfood items, and rumination disorder, which is characterized by regurgitating previously swallowed food to be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out. Prevalence data for pica and rumination disorder is inconclusive. Factors contributing to the development of food eating disorders include a complex combination of interpersonal, social, behavioral, biological, and psychological dynamics. Interpersonal and psychological issues include low self-esteem, feelings of inadequacy, lack of control, and an inability to express emotions. Social factors may include peer pressure to look thin, being ridiculed over one’s appearance, and being bullied or being physically, emotionally, or sexually abused. Family dynamics also play a role in the development of FEDs. Current research is investigating the role of biological and genetic factors in the development of FEDs.


Psychologists, counselors, clinical social workers, psychiatrists, medical physicians, and nutritionists treat food eating disorders. A combination of psychotherapy and group counseling provided simultaneously with medical and nutritional interventions is the most effective form of treatment. Counseling addresses the


underlying psychological, interpersonal, social, cultural, and family dynamics that contribute to the eating disorder. Medical and nutritional professionals monitor, guide, and equip clients in recovery, leading to healthier food-related behaviors. When FEDs become severe, intensive inpatient treatment may be necessary. The	National	Eating	Disorders	Association (NEDA), founded in 2001, is a leading nonprofit prevention and advocacy organization that assists individuals and families better understand FEDs. The NEDA maintains an extensive online web presence. FEDs are complex and serious health conditions that develop in a variety of ways. FEDs are treatable, with full recovery possible with professional intervention.




Economic and financial stress is often a response to trying unsuccessfully to balance outgoing money for bills and earning enough income. It is a common challenge that many face in an attempt to meet personal and family financial obligations. In times of economic





decline, such as a recession, many Americans blame the economy for the majority of stress they experience. Numerous studies have found a strong link between economic and financial stress and an increased rate of mental health issues. Economic downturns, such as the Great Depression or the U.S. recession that began in 2007 and lasted well into 2013, were linked to increased rates of psychological disorders, including depression, suicide, substance abuse, domestic violence, and antisocial behavior. Among the most significant factors in the onset of mental health are job loss and underemployment, both of which have been connected to depression and substance abuse.


• Economic and financial stress is the physical and emotional response to external events that affect an individual and/or his or her family’s economic stability. It can be triggered by the loss of a job or home or any change in economic status or stability.


form of stress can have a large effect on four key mental health concerns: major depression and anxiety disorders, suicide, substance abuse, and violent behavior. There is a higher rate of suicide among those who are unemployed.


One of the most common causes of economic and financial stress among young adults has to do with being overwhelmed by college loan debt. Not only do these young adults leave college with hefty student loans, many have a difficult time finding work in their respective fields or at adequate salaries, which only adds to their inability to pay back the loans. This, in turn, has hurt other industries, as this generation is not spending money on cars, homes, or building families and instead are working simply to make loan payments. Economic and financial stress has also led many young adults to remain living with their parents after college graduation and for some even after starting families.


   Economic and financial stress is a common occurrence for many during a bad economy, but the problem is a chronic one for those living near or below the poverty line. Many individuals become frustrated by the high prices associated with groceries, gas, and other necessities. Unemployment has plagued many Americans, causing devastation and financial ruin for families all over the country. Financial and economic stress is often experienced when working on budgets, paying bills, worrying about saving money for emergencies, or being able to afford necessary items. Financial and economic stress can also be influenced by an attempt to maintain social status.
   There are different emotional and physical responses to economic and financial stress. Some individuals may have difficulty sleeping, experience weight gain or loss, or develop symptoms of anxiety, such as panic attacks.
   Throughout U.S. history, there have been several major turns in the economy that have brought on great stress, frustration, and concern for many. The loss of jobs, income, and even homes can often lead to significant mental distress. There is also concern that this



Ecstasy is a synthetic, psychoactive drug—known as MDMA—which produces stimulant and hallucinogenic effects.





• Catecholamines are a group of neurotransmitters released by the brain in response to acute stress. These include dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
• Dopamine is a chemical messenger in the brain that transmits nerve impulses that regulate attention, concentration, emotion, movement, impulse control, and judgment.
• Neurotransmitters are a group of chemical messengers in the brain that messages to other nerve cells. Common neurotransmitters include acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.
• Norepinephrine is a chemical messenger in the brain that serves to transmit nerve impulses that regulate attention and power the “fight-flight” stress response. As such, it causes constriction of blood vessels. It is also called noradrenaline. Serotonin is a chemical messenger in the brain that serves to transmit nerve impulses that regulate mood in terms of calmness, happiness, pain, sexuality, and sleep. Low levels are associated with depression and compulsivity.


Ecstasy is the popular name for the synthetic, psychoactive drug MDMA. It is known as a club drug and has several street names, including Adam, B-bombs, bean, Blue Nile, clarity, crystal, decadence, disco biscuit, E, essence, Eve, go, hug drug, Iboga, love drug, molly, morning shot, pollutants, Rolls Royce, Snackies, speed for lovers, sweeties, wheels, X, and XTC. It is chemically similar to methamphetamine and to mescaline. Ecstasy acts both as a stimulant and as a psychedelic, producing an energizing effect as well as distortions in time and perception and enhanced enjoyment from tactile experiences. Ecstasy exerts its primary effects in the brain on neurons that use the neurotransmitter serotonin to communicate with other neurons. Serotonin is central in regulating mood, aggression, sexual activity, sleep, and


sensitivity to pain. Most users take ecstasy orally. Users also sometimes inhale or inject it. Although ecstasy is available as a capsule or a powder, it is usually sold in tablet form.
   Ecstasy is absorbed quickly after being ingested and can be detected in the blood within 30 minutes. While its peak effects occur in 60 to 90 minutes, the main effects last three to five hours. Women are more sensitive to ecstasy than men and are more likely to experience an optimal effect of the drug at a lower dose, proportional to weight, than men. Most users of ecstasy are white teenagers and young adults from middle and upper-class households. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2010, an estimated 695,000 Americans had used Ecstasy within the past month, and almost 1 million Americans report using it for the first time. Marijuana, alcohol, and cocaine are commonly used with ecstasy.
   Ecstasy was first synthesized in 1912 by Merck, the pharmaceutical giant, which patented it in 1914. The name “ecstasy” was coined in the early 1980s to increase the market for the drug. Ecstasy became popular as a club drug and was often sold in nightclubs and bars. By the mid-1980s.the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration banned ecstasy. Currently, it is classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical value.


an herbal version of ecstasy has been widely available. Although those who take herbal ecstasy believe it to be a legal, safe alternative to ecstasy, there are reports of numerous adverse effects, including severe reactions such as high blood pressure, seizures, heart attacks, strokes, and death. Ecstasy in the form of MDMA causes the release of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Research shows that chronic use of MDMA causes brain damage by destroying neurons that release serotonin resulting in memory problems that persist for at least two weeks after stopping use of the drug. Long-term effects of ecstasy use may result in shrinkage of the hippocampus, resulting in cognitive impairment. Other research has found that the use of





this drug damages neurons that regulate dopamine resulting in tremors, unsteady gait, and paralysis, which are symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Exposure to MDMA during pregnancy is associated with learning deficits that last into adulthood.
   While most users report intensely pleasurable experiences after taking ecstasy, about 25% of users also report undesirable experiences. Short-term adverse reactions that have been reported include dilated pupils, unusual sensitivity to bright light, headache, sweating, increased heart rate, tooth grinding, spasms of the jaw muscle, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle aches, fatigue, dizziness, vertigo, thirst, numbness, tingling skin, retention of urine, staggering gait, unsteadiness, tics, tremors, restlessness, agitation, paranoia, and nystagmus. Diving a car under the influence of ecstasy is unsafe. The depletion of serotonin seems to cause “midweek blues,” which is the lethargy, concentration and memory problems, and depressed mood that many ecstasy users experience for a few days after taking the drug. Finally, ecstasy users tend to develop tolerance to the drug with repeated use. Novice users may take one or two tablets per session, whereas experienced users may need to take three or more tablets to achieve the same effect. Heavy users sometimes binge use, either by taking several tablets simultaneously or by repeatedly taking tablets during a single session that may last up to 48 hours.


Effexor is a prescribed antidepressant medication used to treat depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Its generic name is venlafaxine.

• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially fatal condition resulting from combining medications and characterized by severe muscle rigidity (stiffening), fever, sweating, high blood pressure, delirium, and sometimes coma.
• Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) in the brain believed to regulate mood.
• Selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are medications that act on and increase the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain that influences mood. They differ from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which act only on serotonin.
• Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) in the brain believed to regulate attention, mood, and powers the “fight-flight” stress response.
• Serotonin syndrome is a serious medication reaction resulting from an excess of serotonin in the brain. It occurs when a number of medications that increase serotonin are taken together. Symptoms include high blood pressure, high fever, headache, delirium, shock, and coma.


Effexor is in the class of antidepressant medication known as serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). It is primarily used to treat depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Effexor has also been used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and irritable bowel syndrome. Effexor has actions common to both the tricyclic antidepressants, such as Tofranil and Elavil, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil. Effexor is thought to work by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain.


Those taking Effexor should be monitored closely for insomnia, anxiety, mania, significant weight loss, and





seizures. Its use should also be monitored in children and adults up to age 24 because they are at an increased risk of developing suicidal thoughts. Caution should also be exercised when prescribing Effexor to those with impaired liver or kidney function, those over age 60, children, individuals with known bipolar disorder or a history of seizures, and those with diabetes. Care should be taken to weigh the risks and benefits of Effexor in women who are or wish to become pregnant, as well as in breast-feeding mothers. Those with diabetes should monitor their blood or urine sugar carefully, since Effexor can affect blood sugar. Alcohol should not be used while taking Effexor. Care must be taken in driving, operating machinery, or participating in hazardous activities when taking this medication. Effexor use should not be stopped abruptly since it can cause withdrawal symptoms (serotonin discontinuation syndrome).
   Some common side effects with Effexor use include nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, loss of appetite, blurred vision, nervousness, trouble sleeping, unusual sweating, and yawning. Like other SNRIs sexual side effects are relatively common in Effexor. These include impotence and decreased sex drive.
   Effexor interacts with a number of other medications. Dangerously high blood pressure has resulted from the combination of Effexor and monoamine oxidase inhibitors like Nardil or Parnate. Effexor also interacts with Desyrel, Meridia, and Imitrex and may cause a condition known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Those taking blood thinners, including aspirin, are at risk for increased bleeding when taking Effexor. The sedative effects (drowsiness) of Effexor are increased by other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol, sedatives, sleeping medications, or other medications used for mental disorders such as schizophrenia.

Child psychoanalyst Anna Freud’s most popular work, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense, discusses how human defense mechanisms protect the psyche from states of stress and anxiety.


• Anna Freud, daughter of Sigmund Freud, is best known as the founder of child psychoanalysis, developer of ego psychology, and author of The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense.
• Defense mechanisms are unconscious, maladaptive coping strategies that people use to prevent unpleasant feelings and experiences.
• Ego psychology is a formal theory of psychoanalytic thought based on Freud’s structural model of the id, ego, and superego and their related functions.



Considered the founding text in ego psychology and child psychoanalysis, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense, written by Anna Freud (1895–1982), was first published in German in Vienna in 1936. Due to its popularity it was translated into English soon after, two years before Sigmund Freud’s death. It has since been updated/revised. The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense is the publication that Anna, the youngest of Freud’s six children, is best known for. She is also the only one of Freud’s children to make her own mark in the area of psychoanalysis, credited as the founder of child psychoanalysis. Beginning her professional





career as a schoolteacher, Anna gained firsthand knowledge of children and adolescents. However, after undergoing psychoanalysis with her father, her interests in the field peaked, leading to her eventual professional transition.
   The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense discusses the individual ego’s defense reactions that arise from conflicts among the id, ego, and superego. Human beings tend to react in a variety of ways in an attempt to alleviate feelings of anxiety and stress. These defense mechanisms are unconscious coping strategies that people use to prevent themselves from experiencing unpleasant feelings or situations. Defense mechanisms, though they can result in both positive and negative consequences, are viewed as maladaptive as they attempt to distort, deny, or manipulate reality. Anna Freud listed 10 defense mechanisms based on her father’s works: repression,regression,
reaction formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning against one’s own person, reversal into the opposite, and sublimation/displacement; but she went on to hone this list to five main ones in her later research (repression, regression, projection, reaction formation, and sublimation).

The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense is considered a classic contribution to psychoanalytic psychology. This seminal text provided the foundations of child psychoanalysis as Freud included several clinical illustrations from analysis with children and adolescents. The book remains a staple used in modern-day child psychology courses.



“Ego depletion” is the term used to describe the temporary exhaustion of self-control.


• Psychoanalytic theory is a psychological theory that explains behaviors and perceptions as the result of unconscious, sexual, and biological instincts. This is the original theory of Sigmund Freud.
• Self-control is the capacity for self-discipline. Some use this term interchangeably with willpower.
• Willpower is the ability to resist a short-term temptation in order to achieve a long-term goal. It also involves the ability to delay gratification. Some use this term interchangeably with self-control.


“Ego depletion” is a term used to describe significant expenditure of the mental energy required for self-control or willpower. The depletion of this resource affects the individual’s capacities for further self-control. An example of this is when an individual deliberately forgoes a tasty but unhealthy breakfast but later succumbs to the temptation for a sweet roll and coffee later in the morning. The term “ego depletion” was coined by the American psychologist Roy Baumeister (1953–). He credits Freud and psychoanalytic theory, particularly the concepts of ego and psychic or mental energy. Baumeister considers willpower to be like a muscle. A specific muscle has a given amount of energy to do work and it can be used up slowly or rapidly in a given amount of time. The more work a muscle does in a single action, the more energy is used and the less is available for further action.
   As a muscle’s energy may be used slowly over many small actions or quickly in fewer large actions, so too can an individual’s ability to exert the willpower decrease with his or her choices. That is because individuals have only a limited amount of mental energy that they may utilize in a given amount of time. As





individuals use this energy for self-control, they deplete this energy and have less available for the next action. Furthermore, the more difficult a given decision is, the more mental energy is required to act on the decision. Also like muscles, ego depletion is a temporary state. As time lapses between willpower act, the energy used from previous acts is slowly replaced. When it is overused its energy is depleted. So too with self-control. When willpower is overused, an individual’s capacity for self-control is reduced because of ego depletion. Baumeister’s research shows that ego depletion is linked to depletion of blood glucose (sugar) levels. More specifically, ego depletion causes a slowdown in regions of the brain associated with self-control. In short, ego depletion results in slower brain functioning, which subsequently diminishes willpower. At the same time, it also increases cravings for food, alcohol, drugs, and other forbidden desires. In addition, ego depletion increases the intensity of feelings, particularly negative or unpleasant ones. Fortunately, there are strategies for increasing willpower and decreasing ego depletion.


“Ego development” refers to the psychological concept of the ego and the nature of its development across the human lifespan.


The ego is the internal process that allows a person to make sense of the world around him or her and have a distinct personality from all others. It is the lens though which all experiences are captured. The ego is the person within the human body.


   The most prominent conceptualization of ego is that of Jane Loevinger (Loevinger, 1976). Loevinger theorizes that the ego is a holistic construct that unifies the personality into a single whole. The ego develops a frame of reference within a person that integrates all of a person’s experiences into an understanding of the world and how to live in it. Loevinger referred to the ego as the “master trait” that organizes our experiences and shapes how we make meaning, develop a worldview, and gain a sense of self. The ego changes on one’s experiences, so it is always developing. It was important to Loevinger to develop an understanding of the concept of ego based on research. She developed the Washington University Sentence Completion Test, which is the primary measurement of ego development. Loevinger describes four domains that are woven together to form the ego. The first is character development that incorporates impulse control and moral development. The second domain is cognitive style that includes conceptual complexity and cognitive development. The third is interpersonal style that defines our attitudes toward relationships and other people. The forth domain is conscious preoccupations, which are the focus of the most dominant conscious thoughts and behaviors. The focus of our thoughts and behaviors changes over time and can include focusing on getting our needs met, or conformity to rules, and many other
foci depending on one’s age and experiences.
   Loevinger theorized that the ego develops in stages and each stage is built on the previous stage. Each stage represents a restructuring of the self and greater awareness of self, others, personal autonomy, and responsibility. Loevinger proposed nine stages of ego development.

Presocial and symbiotic stage. This is early infancy with exclusive focus on gratification of immediate needs and attachment to mother. There is no language at this stage. No conceptualization of others or self.
Impulsive stage. Asserting a growing sense of self, demanding, impulsive, dependent, a focus on bodily feelings, and age-appropriate sexuality and aggression. Dichotomous thinking, that is, categorizes experiences as either good or bad/nice to me or mean to me.





Self-protective stage. Beginning to develop self-control, complaining, blaming; focus on not getting caught and learning rules and externalizing blame.
Conformist stage. Beginning to conform to social norms and rules, invested in belonging, black and white thinking, cognitive simplicity, and moralistic. Belonging to and gaining approval of group is most valued.
Self-aware. Increasing but limited self-awareness; self-critical and beginning to become aware of inner feelings about self and others; beginning to reflect on God, death, relationships, and health.
Conscientious. Rules are internalized, responsible, self-critical, reflective, and empathic; true conceptual complexity, able to discern patterns, and can see the broader social perspective; guilt triggered by hurting others and morality is based on principles.
Individualistic. Increasing sense of individuality, recognition of individual differences, and emotional dependence; awareness of inner conflicts without need to resolve; value relationships over achievements; unique expression of self.
Autonomous. Respectful of autonomy of self and others. Relationships are understood as emotionally interdependent rather than dependent or independent; high toleration for ambiguity and conceptual complexity; able to cope with inner conflicts between needs and duties. Deepening self-acceptance results in self-fulfillment valued over achievement.
Integrated. A rare stage to attain. Empathic and wise with a full sense of identity and self-actualization; at peace with self and seeks to further understand and fulfill potential intrinsic nature; reconciled to one’s destiny.


Ego development will continue to be a focus of inquiry as social researchers seek to further understand human relationships, needs, and challenges.






Ego psychology is a form of psychoanalysis. It is based on Freud’s model of the mind and the role of the ego in managing competing demands.


• Defense mechanisms are strategies for self-protection against anxiety and other negative emotions that accompany stress.
• Ego depletion is the term used to describe the temporary exhaustion of self-control. It is also known as willpower depletion.
• Object relations is a form of psychoanalytic psychology which explains the essential need for close relationship. The attempted fulfillment of this need through mental representations of self and others is believed to determine one’s motivations and behaviors.
• Oedipus complex is the desire for sexual involvement with the parent of the opposite sex and a concurrent sense of rivalry with the parent of the same sex. Freud considered the complex a critical stage in normal developmental.
• Psychoanalysis is a theory of human behavior and a form of therapy based on psychoanalytic theory. In psychoanalysis clients are encouraged to talk freely about personal experiences, particularly their early childhood and dreams. It was initially developed by Sigmund Freud.





• Psychoanalytic psychology is a psychological theory that explains behaviors and perceptions as the result of unconscious, sexual, and biological instincts. It was originally developed by Sigmund Freud.
• Psychotic disorder is a severe mental condition in which an individual loses touch with reality. Symptoms can include hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking.
• Subconscious is the part of the conscious mind which consists of information that is not in awareness unless attention is directed to it. It is also called the preconscious.
• Unconscious is the part of the conscious mind which consists of the primitive, instinctual wishes and information that operates without awareness and over which one does not have active control.



Ego psychology is a form of psychoanalysis. It is based on Sigmund Freud’s (1856–1939) theory about how the human mind is structured. According to Freud, the mind is divided into three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego. Each of these parts has specific functions and develops at different times during childhood. The id (German for “it”) is the primitive instinctual drive. It is present at birth and is concerned with gratification and pleasure. The id operates under what Freud called the “pleasure principle.” It is considered to be irrational because it is not based on reality. The ego (Greek for “I”) develops between six and eight months after birth. One function of the ego is to manage the impulses of the id in rational, socially acceptable ways. The final part of the mind to develop is the superego. This occurs in the first few years of life and is the result of the resolution of the Oedipus complex. The superego is responsible for an individual’s notion of right and wrong. It is concerned with morality and rules. The superego reflects the beliefs and values of a child’s caregivers, usually parents. Like the id, the superego is also irrational. Freud further separated the mind into conscious and unconscious realms. He described three


levels of human consciousness. At the surface (or top level) is the conscious; just below this is the preconscious or subconscious, and at the very bottom is the unconscious. The id and superego operate outside of individuals’ awareness in the subconscious. The ego is both conscious and subconscious, with some material held in the preconscious memory. According to Freud, there are different layers. One of the main goals of psychoanalysis is to make individuals aware of their subconscious thoughts and drives in order to change their behavior.
   The ego must balance the competing demands of the id, the superego, and society in general. According to ego psychology, personality is determined by the way in which an individual’s ego manages the conflicting pressures of the id and the superego. The ego has many functions with which to accomplish this task. Some of these are reality testing, impulse control, object relations, and defense mechanisms. Reality testing is the ability to distinguish what is happening in one’s own mind from the outside world. This function allows individuals to see themselves as separate from their environments and respond to various stimuli in appropriate ways. Those who experience symptoms of psychotic disorders such as hallucinations or delusions are unable to do this. Impulse control is the ability to hold back urges without acting on them. For example, the primitive instinctual drive may prompt an individual to assault someone who cuts him or her off in traffic. The healthy ego will inhibit this behavior and satisfy the urge in more acceptable ways. Those with impulse control disorders and addictions are said to have poor ego functioning in this area. Object relations refers to the way individuals perceive themselves and others. This is based on childhood development and early experiences with others. Finally, defense mechanisms are a primary way in which the ego manages the competing demands of the id and superego. A defense is an unconscious effort to protect individuals from unacceptable or uncomfortable feelings. Some of these are considered primitive, while others are more sophisticated and mature. Splitting is an example of an immature defense mechanism. It occurs when others are considered all good or all bad, with no middle ground. Humor is an example of a mature defense mechanism. 


Elavil is a prescription antidepressant medication used to treat various forms of depression and some forms of pain. Its generic name is amitriptyline.

• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare and life-threatening complication of antipsychotic medication use. The syndrome is characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, changed mental status, or changes in book pressure.
• Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a class of antidepressant medications that work by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin in nerve cells and raising its level in the brain.
• Tricyclic antidepressants are an older class of antidepressants called tricyclic because of their three-ring chemical structure.


Elavil is in the class of medications known as tricyclic antidepressants. Elavil and the other tricyclics are thought to work by blocking reabsorption of neurotransmitters (chemicals messengers), particularly serotonin. They have long been used to treat depressive disorders but have largely been replaced by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Elavil is sometimes


prescribed for various types of chronic pain, including cancer pain and neuropathic pain (nerves), and to prevent migraine headaches. Since it is usually given at bedtime, it also promotes sleep.


Elavil should not be stopped abruptly. Instead, the dose should be decreased gradually and then discontinued. Headache, nausea, and a worsening of original symptoms are likely if it is stopped abruptly. Individuals may need to stop this medication before surgery. Children and adults up to age 24 are at an increased risk of developing suicidal thoughts or behaviors when they first begin taking Elavil and other antidepressants. Those taking the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like Parnate or Nardil should not combine it with Elavil. Elavil should be used with caution in those with glaucoma, seizures, urinary retention, overactive thyroid, poor liver or kidney function, alcoholism, asthma, digestive disorders, enlarged prostate, seizures, or heart disease. Since fetal deformities have been reported with taking this drug during pregnancy, women should discuss the risks and benefits of Elavil with their doctors. Breast-feeding should be avoided while using Elavil.
Common mild side effects of Elavil can include
drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, weight gain, or trouble urinating. More serious but uncommon side effects include easy bruising, persistent heartburn, shaking, mask-like facial expressions, muscle spasms, severe stomach pain, decreased sexual desire, impotence, or painful breasts. Medical attention should be sought for these rare but serious side effects: black stools, vomit that looks like coffee grounds, severe dizziness, fast and irregular heartbeat, fainting, or seizures. Elavil occasionally causes a very serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
   Elavil may decrease the therapeutic effective of some medications used to treat high blood pressure. It should not be taken with other antidepressants, particularly MAOIs, or with Ritalin. It should not be taken with Tagamet or Neo-Synephrine or other over-the-counter medications without checking with one’s doctor. Those taking Elavil should avoid the natural remedies like St. John’s wort and belladonna. Because





black tea can decrease the absorption of this medication, Elavil should be taken at least two hours before or after drinking such tea.




Elder abuse is the physical, sexual, or emotional abuse of an elderly individual, usually one who is disabled or frail. It is also called senior abuse.


• Abandonment involves the desertion of a vulnerable elder by anyone who has assumed the responsibility for care or custody of that individual.
• Emotional abuse involves inflicting mental pain, anguish, or distress on an elder person through verbal or nonverbal acts.
• Exploitation involves illegal taking, misuse, or concealment of funds, property, or assets of a vulnerable elder.
• Neglect involves refusal or failure by those responsible to provide food, shelter, health care or protection for a vulnerable elder.
• Physical abuse involves inflicting, or threatening to inflict, physical pain or injury on a vulnerable elder or depriving the elder of a basic need.


• Sexual abuse involves nonconsensual sexual contact of any kind, coercing an elder to witness sexual behaviors.

Elder abuse is harm or abuse of individuals over the age of 65. It is a crime that all health-care and social service professionals are mandated to report. It can involve abandonment, emotional abuse, exploitation, neglect, physical abuse, or sexual abuse. It is not uncommon for an elder to experience more than one type of mistreatment at the same or different times. For example, someone who financially exploits an elder may also neglect to provide appropriate care in the form of food, medication, or shelter. There are two categories of elder abuse. One is domestic elder abuse, which is committed by someone with whom the elder has a special relationship such as a spouse or child. The other is institutional abuse, which is committed by a caregiver obliged to provide care and protection in a residential facility such as an assisted living facility (nursing home) or group home. The National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA) reported that in 2013 nearly 6 million cases of elder abuse were reported.
The typical victim of elder abuse is a 75-year-old Caucasian female who lives with an adult child on whom she depends. Those with Alzheimer’s disease or other types of dementias are twice as likely to be abused. This often occurs because of unsettling personality changes in these individuals. Demented elderly can be exasperating due to their memory loss, incontinence (loss of bladder control), and frequent aggressive behavior. Such factors are extremely taxing on caretakers. The result can be full-blown elder abuse and the resulting shame. The NCEA predicts that elder abuse will continue to rise. Among the many factors supporting this prediction is that the elderly and their adult children are expected to spend increasingly more time together. Because of increasing life expectancy, adult children can expect to spend more time taking care of their aging parents than their parents took care of them! The child might have been at home for the first 18 to 20 years of life. However, with elders living into their late 80s and early 90s, an adult child might have to take responsibility for a parent over 65 for 25





or more years. Elder abuse may be one of the most distressing and difficult situations that adult children will face in their lives.



• Therapeutic clonic seizure is a type of seizure in which an individual loses consciousness and has convulsions characterized by repetitive, jerking (clonic) movements.

Electroconvulsive therapy is a medical intervention for the treatment of major depression and severe mental disorders in individuals who have not responded to other treatments. ECT is administered by placing electrodes on one or both sides of the head and passing a brief electrical impulse through the brain. This procedure is performed while the individual is under anesthesia. Its purpose is to induce a therapeutic clonic seizure that lasts for about 15 seconds. The expected benefit is that the individual’s symptoms may remit. How ECT works is unknown, but there are a number of theories for explaining its effectiveness. One theory suggests that ECT causes an alteration of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain that results

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical intervention for severe mental disorders in which seizures are induced with an electrical impulse. It is also referred to as shock treatment or electroshock therapy.

• Amnesia is a disturbance of memory characterized by partial or total inability to recall past experiences. It can result from trauma or from medication or electroconvulsive therapy.
• Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by periodic loss of consciousness with or without convulsions. It is caused by brain damage, or the cause may be unknown.
• Metrazol is a synthetic stimulant pharmaceutical used to produce electrical stimulation in the brain and induce seizures.
• Seizure is uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain which can produce convulsions (spasms), loss of consciousness, amnesia, or physical symptoms depending on its cause and the area of the brain affected.

in increased mood and energy. Another theory suggests that ECT modifies stress hormone regulation in the brain, resulting in positive outcomes. Treatment outcomes can be influenced by the placement of electrodes, frequency and duration of the treatments, and the electrical voltage or waveform of the shock.

Constance Pascal (1877–1937), a French psychiatrist, introduced the term “shock.” Previously the term “shock” had been used in medicine to imply a combination of low body temperature (hypothermia) and low blood pressure (hypotension). In 1926, she wrote a book titled Le Traitement Desmaladies Mentales Par Les Chocs. In that book Pascal theorized that psychopathology was due to mental shock. Therefore, to treat mental illness and restore healthy functioning of the brain, she argued that the brain and body must be shocked back into balance. She believed that this could be achieved through the injection of gold, insulin, or vaccines. A year later, psychiatrists began experimenting with injecting large doses of insulin to induce a form of shock. This research was further developed by Manfred Sakel (1900–1957) and the result was termed





“insulin coma therapy” (ICT). ICT was the first type of shock therapy.
   Ladislas Meduna (1896–1964) was a psychiatrist who believed that seizures were an essential component of effective shock therapy. His theory was based on his

Electroencephalography (EEG)

studies of biopsies of human brain tissues from individuals with epilepsy and major mental disorders. Seizures

often occur in comas and both are forms of shock. Meduna began injecting camphor and Metrazol to induce seizures. Meduna went on to work with Ugo Cerletti (1877–1963) of the Rome University psychiatry clinic. Cerletti suggested using electricity instead of Metrazol to induce seizures. Cerletti and a colleague Lucio Bini (1908–1964) are credited with inventing ECT in 1938. ECT is a controversial treatment modality. The main concern is whether its benefits outweigh risks, which include brain damage and memory loss. Peter Breggin (1936–), an American psychiatrist, is one of the most vocal critic of ECT. He believes ECT causes closed head injury and advocates for replacing it, as well as psychiatric medications, with more humanistic approaches like psychotherapy and education. Although advancements in research and technology have rendered ECT a safe procedure, the controversy still exists. Because of such concerns, ECT is rarely used
as the first attempted intervention.
   Today, ECT is used primarily to treat chronic mental conditions where other interventions have failed. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are modern variations of ECT. Both VNS and TMS are more precise methods of inducing seizures.

Electroencephalography is a medical diagnostic test that records electrical activity on the scalp to evaluate various brain functions and psychological disorders. It is also known as the brain wave test.


• Computed tomography is a medical diagnostic test in which computer-processed X-rays produce tomographs (cross-sectional images) of body areas.
• Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain.
• Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures with or without a loss of consciousness.
• Fast Fourier transform is a mathematical process used in EEG analysis to investigate the composition of an EEG signal.
• Magnetic resonance imaging is a medical diagnostic test which uses electromagnetic radiation and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed images of the brain and internal organs.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a neurological test for recording electrical activity of the brain. Electrodes are placed in a standard pattern on the individual’s scalp. The electrodes are then connected to a recording device. This device makes a continuous graphic record of the individual’s brain activity (brain waves) on a strip of recording paper or computer screen. This graphic record is called an EEG. If the display is computerized, it is called a digital EEG. Usually, the EEG takes about one hour to administer. However, long-term EEG monitoring is often used for diagnosis of seizure disorders or sleep disorders.





   The EEG is a useful tool in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy and other seizure disorders. Also, the EEG is a useful test in making or confirming the diagnosis of stroke, brain tumors, encephalitis, and sleep disorders. It can also determine brain status and brain death. A quantitative version of the EEG (qEEG) produces a brain map that can increase the test’s diagnostic value. The qEEG involves modifying the EEG signals with a computer using the fast Fourier transform algorithm. The result is displayed on a schematic map of the head to form a topographic image. This brain map is particularly useful in the diagnosis of Al-zheimer’s disease and mild closed-head injuries. It can also identify areas of the brain with abnormally slow activity and differentiate between early dementia (increased slowing) and uncomplicated depression (no slowing). The qEEG is also known as BEAM (brain electrical activity mapping).

In 1924, the German psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873–1941) recorded the first human EEG. Since that time the use of this neurological test has greatly expanded because of refinements such as BEAM and magneto-encephalograph (MEG). MEG measures both the individual’s electrical field and activity and the associated magnetic field. This magnetic field is detected with a biomagnetometer and recorded as an MEG. Data provided by it is quite different from that provided by computed tomography and or magnetic resonance imaging. Both of these brain imaging instruments provide still images of the brain. These images are useful in providing structural and anatomical information. In contrast, MEG provides information on the brain in real time. It is used to map cognitive functions such as speech, memory, attention, and consciousness. MEG also provides surgeons with real-time computer-generated images of lesions (tumors) essential in planning surgery.


“Electronic communication” refers to communicating through the use of electronic media such as computers, cellular phones, fax machines, or other devices using e-mail, voice mail, texting, instant messaging, and/or video conferencing. Electronic communication is any type of communicating that is based on electricity; it is also referred to as computer-mediated communication (CMC).


• Computer-mediated	communication (CMC) describes the electronic means of communicating via the Internet including e-mailing, text messaging, social networking, and video conferencing.
• Electronic messaging is the sending and receiving of an e-mail, instant message, or text message from a computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet.
• Transmission is the act of sending a message in the form of text, picture, or video or other information from a given source.


Electronic communication describes the sending and receiving of information through the use of various types of electronic media. These vehicles for communication include television, radio, desktop computers, cellular phones or other handheld devices, fax machines, gaming consoles, and/or electronic tablets. Use of electronic media differs from static, or print, media in that it is interactive. People use several types of electronic

While such communication has brought the world closer together than ever before, it can also lead to misunderstandings and can be used to commit harmful acts such as cyberbullying. 

communication, such as e-mail, text messaging, social networking, and video conferencing. Electronic means of communication has drastically increased over the past few decades with advances in technology. Prior to these advancements, communication was limited to what a person could see and hear in front of him or her or how far the person was able to physically travel to transport that information via land, sea, or air. However, the development of the World Wide Web and the Internet has changed that, making it possible for people to communicate with one another regardless of their proximity. It also permits communication to happen almost instantaneously. Using these means, people are able to communicate greater amounts of information more quickly and cost effectively, over greater


distances, and to larger numbers of people. This form of communication affords users with both personal and professional benefits.
   Electronic communication allows people to transmit various types of media (text, pictures, sound, video) into a single message. This can greatly enhance the communication experience and provide a richer context to the information being sent. However, studies indicate that approximately 60%–90% of information is communicated nonverbally. Effective communication thus relies on both the content of the message and the intent of the sender of that message. Therefore, the sender must be clear in determining both in order for the message to be received accurately. Experts have argued that no form of electronic communication can replace the traditional, face-to-face experience.
   The foundation for electronic modes of communication began in the late 19th century with Thomas Edison and direct current electricity. The next invention that significantly impacted this movement was the telegraph and the use of Morse Code. Alexander Graham Bell’s invention of the telephone soon followed. Next came transmitting messages via radio waves, which was a popular means because of its ease and cost effectiveness. The first computer was developed in the early 1940s and drastically changed the way people communicate. Developments in this media then exploded in the 1970s and 1980s with companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Macintosh. The National Science Foundation also created the basis of the Internet in the late 1980s. The 1990s on into the 21st century has seen much expansion in modes of electronic communication, with cellular phones, tablets, and the use of social networking.

Reports indicate that over 70% of all communication nowadays is communicated electronically. While this type of communication is on the rise, many people are not adequately trained in its use and this can lead to miscommunication and error, which can be problematic in social settings and business dealings. Adolescents, teens, and young adults in particular are subgroups that are using electronic means of communicating at high rates. Technology statistics from the PEW Internet and American Life Project indicated that





71% of teens own a cell phone, 94% utilize the Internet (with more than half using it daily), 58% have a profile on a social networking site, and 26% maintain a personal web page. Determining which types of interactions can be communicated effectively using electronic means and what should be done via phone call or face-to-face is imperative.


Albert Ellis was an American psychologist who developed rational emotive behavioral therapy.


Albert Ellis was an influential American psychologist and author. He began his career as a sexologist before pioneering the development of rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), a form of psychotherapy that focuses on disputing irrational thoughts, beliefs, and expectations. It evolved from rational therapy and rational emotive therapy. Disputation is a therapeutic technique consisting of a series of questions asked by the therapist to guide a client away from irrational beliefs and toward more helpful and healthy thought patterns. Designed to help people actively overcome challenges and live more fulfilled lives, REBT grew from a fringe school of thought to become a major philosophy and practice. A prolific writer and active


social commentator, Ellis continually advocated the use of intention-based REBT therapy for changing patient behavior and beliefs in a variety of personal and social situations.
   A charismatic and influential psychotherapist, Albert Ellis significantly shifted the course of his chosen profession over the course of his lifetime. Originally a proponent of traditional psychoanalysis, his expertise in sex and sexual practices, and his personal behavior modifications led him to create rational emotive behavior therapy in the late 1950s. Part of the cognitive-based therapy family, REBT is a hands-on, engaged system for helping patients identify and modify their beliefs to allow for more healthy/rational thoughts and greater personal well-being.
   Immensely popular with the general public through his best-selling self-help books, Ellis’s approach was initially viewed as little more than a provocative, fringe-element challenge by his peers. They criticized his directive and confrontational methods, which were in sharp contrast to the general practices of the day. Yet Ellis’s models of treatment became increasingly accepted because it worked—often quite quickly—in the lives of his clients. Over his 60-year career, his work moved to the mainstream and permanently altered the modern therapeutic landscape. By the 1980s, he was universally viewed as one of the profession’s most influential figures along with Sigmund Freud and Carl Rogers, winning many national and international achievement awards.
   Credited with more than 800 scientific papers and some 80 full-length books, Albert Ellis was an outspoken voice for change with the psychoanalytic community. However, his voice was not universally welcomed, as his theories were a sharp departure from the methods that dominated the 1950s when he began publishing his REBT works. Profane, provocative, directive, and confrontational, Ellis was also considered warm, funny, and deeply committed to helping his clients improve their lives.
   Born into a poor family, Ellis was a shy and sickly child with distant parents. He was frequently hospitalized but used his early challenges to test coping methods that became the foundations of his REBT practice. For example, he challenged himself to talk to 100 unknown females to get over his fear of rejection, and through this and other behavior-changing

experiments he developed an early interest in counseling philosophies.
   Still, he traveled a circuitous path to psychotherapy, trying his hand at business and writing fiction before turning to the field. Early on, he focused on human sexuality, partnering with Kinsey and publishing several notable books, including the influential Sex without Guilt in 1958. This gave him early recognition as a pioneering thinker in the American sexual revolution of the 1960s and provided him with valuable experience using cognitive interventions to shift both belief and behavior.
   
These experiences, coupled with his childhood behavior modification experiments, led him to challenge the dominant psychoanalytical practices of the 1950s and 1960s, which were nondirective and passive when dealing with clients. In sharp contrast, Ellis favored a directive, intentional approach designed to challenge and lead clients to a more rational and healthy way of thinking and living.
   This approach contained several practices that were considered groundbreaking at the time but are now widely accepted. For example, Ellis promoted scientific and outcome-based testing of psychoanalytic





approaches to evaluate their true effectiveness with different client populations. He assigned homework to reinforce sessions, insisting that learning did not happen solely in the therapeutic environment. Multiple approaches beyond talk therapy were encouraged, including anything that pushed the client to change, such as group sessions, hypnotherapy, imagery, and singing. While his peers were shocked, his clients praised him for getting results in their lives. His ABCDE framework allowed the therapist and client together to challenge thought patterns and recognize “irrational” beliefs that were holding the client back from desired achievements. During his weekly Friday night workshops held at his New York institute, he demonstrated his approach with volunteers in front of a live audience, beginning in 1965 and continuing until his death. Despite publishing a mountainous amount of literature, traveling and speaking globally, marrying three times, and running multiple institutes dedicated to his theories, it is estimated he personally conducted over 300,000 therapeutic sessions before his death
in 2007.
   Ellis’s status as an influencer has not diminished since his death. His REBT theories continue to shape modern psychotherapeutic practice, with his research actively carried on by his widow, Debbie Joffe Ellis, and the Albert Ellis Institute in New York. While other types of cognitive behavior therapy, a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts, are perhaps now more widespread, there is no denying that elements of his REBT teachings paved the way.
   Even outside of the psychoanalytic community, his plain-English self-help books remain on shelves around the world, enduringly popular and continuously encouraging the general public to adopt his tenets of rational living.

Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify and make sense of one’s own emotions and the emotions of others. It is also known as EQ.

• Countertransference refers to the feelings evoked within a clinician during psychotherapy. Unless recognized and dealt with, these feelings can interfere with treatment.
• Hard-wired means genetically determined.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapy and therapeutic counseling.





• Transference refers to the feelings evoked within a client during therapy with a mental health practitioner. Feelings the client has, or had, for someone else are directed toward the therapist.


Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the capacity to recognize, understand, and manage personal emotions and to identify and respond to the emotions of others. It influences how individuals think, behave, interact with others, and make decisions. Emotional intelligence is different from intelligence (IQ), which is the capacity to learn, reason, and problem solve. Intelligence remains relatively stable throughout life, whereas emotional intelligence can be learned and developed.
   The term “emotional intelligence” was originally used in 1964 by Michael Beldoch (1931–) in the book The Communication of Emotional Meaning. The term became better known because of psychologist Daniel Goleman’s (1946–) best-selling book Emotional Intelligence—Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, published in 1995. Goleman contends that emotional intelligence is equally important, if not more important than IQ. Positive emotions influence an individual to perceive positive events as more likely to arise in the future. The opposite is true of negative emotions. They influence an individual to perceive negative events as more likely to happen. In other words, different emotions lead to different thoughts, perceptions, expectations, and behaviors. Individuals with the ability to express, understand, and manage their emotions are better able to estimate the likelihood of a future event and the possibilities associated with it. They are also better able to attend to internal and external events and regulate their mood to effectively cope with situations. The human brain is hardwired so that emotions have an advantage over thoughts. Whenever an individual touches, tastes, smells, sees, or hears something, electrical signals are sent to the brain. Before getting to the part of the brain where logic and reason takes place, these signals travel through the limbic system. The limbic system is where emotions are created and experienced. Therefore, events are first experienced emotionally, and then thoughts follow. Humans do not


have control over emotional experiences but do have control over the thoughts that occur afterward. Awareness of emotions allows for control over the type of response chosen once feelings are experienced. The way an individual responds to emotions is influenced by his or her personal history.
   Emotional intelligence is equally important for therapists as it is for their clients. How a therapist responds to personal feelings that arise (countertransference) during a therapy session can influence the outcome of treatment. Similarly, how a client responds to personal feelings toward the practitioner (transference) will impact the therapeutic process and achievement of treatment goals.
   Emotional intelligence requires four sets of personalandinterpersonalskills. They are self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, and relationship management skills. Self-awareness is the ability to assess one’s own emotions and understand personal patterns of responding to situations. Social awareness is the ability to identify and understand other individuals’ emotions. Self-management is the ability to regulate personal emotions and choose appropriate behaviors. Finally, relationship management is the ability to have awareness of one’s own emotions and the emotions of others and to use this awareness to develop and maintain interpersonal relations. Practice of these skills is necessary to develop the emotional capacity to effectively cope with internal and external stimuli. Emotional intelligence is particularly helpful in dealing with stressful events that have the potential to negatively impact physical and mental well-being.

Emotionally focused psychotherapy is a psychotherapy approach for increasing awareness, understanding, and ability to manage emotional experiences. It is also known as EFT.

• Adaptive means having the ability to adjust to a circumstance.
• Arriving means to get to the place where emotions can be identified and understood.
• Emotion coach refers to the role of the therapist in emotionally focused psychotherapy. The emotion coach collaborates with an individual, couple, or family to assist in the development of emotional awareness, acceptance, and understanding. The emotion coach is the facilitator of emotional change.
• Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage personal emotions and to identify and respond to the emotions of others. It influences how individuals think, behave, interact with others, and make decisions.
• Leaving refers to moving away from the emotions originally arrived at toward transformation of those emotions.
• Maladaptive refers to the inability to adjust to a circumstance.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapy and therapeutic counseling.

Emotionally focused is a form of couple’s therapy that assists in the expression and restructuring of emotional responses. It helps couples change maladaptive emotional reactions toward each other to more adaptive responses that strengthen the relationship. EFT is also


used with individuals and families. EFT views emotions as the fundamental element in development of the self. Emotions have adaptive and maladaptive functions. They are instrumental in helping individuals adapt and respond to their environment. They are biological functions that assist in the appraisal of situations, others, and one’s self. Emotions communicate goals, regulate personal interactions, and influence decisions. Since emotions are significantly influenced by past experiences, they can be negative reactions to events. However, expression of emotions can assist individuals in changing negative responses.
   Emotion-focused psychotherapy subscribes to “bottom-up processing” to assist in changing negative emotional responses. This requires an individual to develop awareness and keep track of physical sensations that arise in the body. Any thoughts that arise are ignored, while physical signals are felt in the fullest until they subside or are appropriately identified. An emotion coach collaborates with an individual to assist in developing awareness and understanding of emotional experiences. Together they identify alternative emotional responses. A supportive, safe, and accepting environment promotes openness and positive interactive experiences that provide emotional comfort. The goal is to identify bodily sensations and feelings, develop adaptive emotional responses, and enhance emotional intelligence. Individuals who have emotional intelligence have awareness and understanding of their own emotions and the emotions of others. They also have the ability to manage their emotions in a way that enhances well-being.
There are two phases in emotionally focused psychotherapy, arriving and leaving. In phase one, the emotions coach guides the individual to “arrive” at his or her emotions by (1) developing awareness of his or her emotions; (2) feeling, accepting, and managing his or her emotions, (3) describing his or her feelings with words to promote problem solving, and (4) helping the individual develop the ability to determine if his or her emotional responses are congruent with his or her feelings. If they are not, helping them assess the main feelings they are experiencing can be very therapeutic. Phase two involves learning how to change maladaptive emotional responses in order to “leave” the emotions the individual initially arrived at. The





emotions coach assists the individual to move forward by helping him or her decide if an emotion is adaptive and should be reinforced or maladaptive and needs to be transformed, identity the thoughts associated with maladaptive emotions, (3) identify and use adaptive emotional responses, and (4) dispute negative thoughts associated with negative emotions and replace them with positive thoughts. The emotions coach plays an instrumental role in helping the individual to develop an awareness and acceptance of his or her emotions. The emotions coach also guides the individual through the process of transforming negative emotional responses into healthy and adaptive emotional responses.


Emotionally focused psychotherapy was developed by Susan Johnson and Leslie Greenberg (1945) in the 1980s. Initially, it was Johnson who discovered that couples with problems remained caught in dysfunction due to negative emotional interactions. She used attachment theory as the foundational element for emotionally focused psychotherapy. Attachment theory describes how individuals in relationships react to a perceived hurt, separation, or threat.
   Emotionally focused psychotherapy is considered one of the most scientifically confirmed therapy treatments in the domain of couples therapy. It integrates components of person-centered, experiential, gestalt, and existential therapy with several theories such as modern emotion, cognitive, attachment, narrative, interpersonal, and psychodynamic theory. It works to improve emotional, psychological, physical, and relationship closeness. Emotionally focused psychotherapy has also been scientifically proven in the treatment of depression. It is gaining recognition in the treatment of other disorders such as trauma, anxiety, and eating disorders.


Empirically supported treatments are therapeutic interventions (techniques) that research demonstrates to be effective in facilitating therapeutic change. It is also known as evidence-based treatments.


• Accountability is the expectation or requirement to conduct evaluations and report performance information.
• Benchmark is a standard by which a product or clinical activity can be measured or evaluated.
• Evidence-based practice is a form of practice that is based on the integration of the best research evidence with clinical experience and client values.
• Health Maintenance Organization is an organization that provides or arranges managed care.
• Managed care is a system of health care that controls costs by placing limits on physicians’ fees and by restricting access to certain medical procedures and providers.
• Practice is a method or process used to accomplish a goal or objective.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking,





feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Randomized controlled trial is a research design in which participants are assigned randomly (by chance) to an experimental treatment or one that receives a comparison treatment or placebo.


Empirically supported treatments (ESTs) are healthcare practices that utilize scientific evidence to defend their use. EST refers to therapeutic interventions demonstrated to be useful in randomized controlled trials or their equivalents. This means that evidence-based treatments have been proven to produce therapeutic change in the controlled contexts of scientific research. These research findings are the evidence that supports the use of certain treatments instead of alternative treatment options.
   EST is similar to the concept of best practices. Both aim to increase accountability of health-care practices. EST is also similar to but different from evidence-based practice (EBP). EBP may include ESTs, but it is larger in scope than treatments. EBP involves specific interventions (practices) used to bring about therapeutic change. However, EBPs do not have the scientific support of ESTs. More specifically, to merit that designation, ESTs demonstrated that they are (1) superior to a placebo treatment in two or more randomized controlled studies, (2) equivalent to a well-established treatment in several rigorous and independent controlled studies, or (3) effective in a large series of single-case controlled studies. At the present time ESTs are performed with treatment manuals that specify how the intervention is to be conducted.

Development and Current Status
Prior to the 1990s, there were no specific guidelines for either clinicians or consumers regarding which treatments to select for which conditions. This changed in 1993, when a task force appointed within the American Psychological Association developed a set of criteria for “empirically validated treatments.” Later these came to be known as ESTs. These treatments have


been proven to produce therapeutic change in controlled contexts of scientific research. There has been considerable controversy about ESTs. Some believe that the controlled context of scientific research cannot be replicated in clinical practice. Others contend that the results of scientific study are generalizable to clinical contexts. For the past two decades this debate has been fueled by the increasing expectation for accountability. Increasingly, medical and psychological practice has become more accountable and evidence based. Division 12 of the American Psychological Association (APA) provides a list of treatments that are empirically supported for use with specific health needs. APA also provides the scientific standards for defining treatment effectiveness.
   Resources for health-care interventions are limited. This fact has created an effort to conduct medical and psychological practice in the most efficient manner possible. EST attempts to achieve get the best results for less money and in the shortest amount of time. Modern use of ESTs has its roots in Health Maintenance Organizations. Managed care was established to increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of health care. ESTs can and do have a critical role in managed care. Managed care encourages and often requires health-care professionals to incorporate ESTs as well as EBPs into the health-care process.



Encopresis disorder is a mental disorder characterized by the voluntary or involuntary passage of stools in a child who has already been toilet trained.

• Behavioral modification is a treatment approach that replaces undesirable behaviors with more desirable ones through positive or negative reinforcement.
• Conduct disorder is a mental disorder characterized by repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others, societal norms, or rules are violated.
• Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent and difficult to pass.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Elimination disorders are a group of DSM-5 disorders characterized by the inappropriate elimination of feces or urine. They include enuresis and encopresis.
• Incontinence is the inability to control the release of feces or urine.
• Laxative is a medication that helps an individual to have a bowel movement.
• Oppositional defiant disorder is a mental disorder in the DSM-5 that is characterized by a pattern of angry and irritable mood, argumentative and defiant behavior, and vindictiveness.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Sexual abuse involves nonconsensual sexual contact of any kind, coercing an elder to witness sexual behaviors.


• Specifiers are extensions to a diagnosis that further clarifies the course, severity, or type of features of a disorder or illness.


Encopresis is one of the DSM-5 elimination disorders. The core feature of encopresis involves an individual repeatedly having bowel movements in inappropriate places after an age when bowel control is normally expected (e.g., on the floor or in the clothing). Encopresis is also referred to as fecal incontinence and soiling. After the age of four years, a child is expected to be toilet trained. After the age of four, if a child is repeatedly having bowel movements regularly and over a period of months in inappropriate places, the child may be diagnosed with encopresis. Encopresis is more prevalent among males and approximately 1% of five-year-olds have this disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   This disorder may be intentional but is more often involuntary. When fecal incontinence is clearly intentional, features of conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder may be present. These disorders include problems with self-control of emotions and behaviors (e.g., being angry, resentful, intimidating others, and violating social norms). Sexual abuse may also be a contributing factor in voluntary encopresis. An individual with voluntary incontinence has control over where and when he or she will have a bowel movement. The individual chooses to have a bowel movement in inappropriate places. Older children may choose to smear feces or hide feces in their home. Younger children with encopresis may act out as a result of a power struggle with their caretaker. When fecal incontinence is involuntary, an individual has no control over bowel movements. Involuntary incontinence usually results from withholding feces, resulting in constipation. As the feces continues to build up in the large intestine, leakage will most likely occur in the individual’s clothing. This may cause a child or individual to feel shameful and avoid social situations. The amount of impairment may depend on the child’s self-esteem; bullying and teasing by peers; and the rejection, anger, and consequences of the caretaker. Nearly 95% of encopresis is due to






   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they have repeated passage of stools in inappropriate places, whether the act is involuntary or intentional. The individual must be at least four years of age (or at an equivalent developmental level) and at least one such event must occur each month for a period of at least three months. Repeated passage of feces in inappropriate places must not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., laxatives) or another medical condition except through the process involving constipation. In addition to the DSM-5 criteria needed to make the diagnosis of encopresis, there are two specifiers that must be included to make this diagnosis. The diagnosis of encopresis can specify whether the disorder is with constipation and an overflow of incontinence. This specifier is made by a physical examination or by history and there is evidence of constipation. Alternatively, the diagnosis of encopresis can specify whether the disorder is without constipation and an overflow of incontinence by history or physical examination (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
The most common cause of encopresis is long-term
constipation. Constipation may occur for several reasons, including stress, low fiber diet, not drinking enough water, lack of exercise, and changes in bathroom routines (e.g., using a bathroom that is not your own). Physical problems associated with the intestine’s inability to move stool may be another cause of encopresis. Another causal factor of encopresis may involve emotional issues. A child may develop a fear or frustration related to toilet training. This may be attributed to premature toilet training and stressful events in the child’s life (e.g., parents divorcing, relocation of residences, the birth of a new child). In some instances, a child may simply refuse to use the toilet.


There are several treatments available for those with encopresis. Addressing the cause of the constipation usually treats involuntary encopresis. Treatment


can include adding more fiber to the individual’s diet, short-term use of a laxative, and increasing the amount of water intake. Involuntary incontinence usually ceases once constipation is resolved. The treatment used for voluntary encopresis will depend on the cause of the disorder. Often scheduling toilet times and praising and rewarding a child for using the toilet may be helpful and eliminate encopresis. Psychotherapy, using behavioral modification, is another form of treatment that has been found to be effective. With proper treatment, prognosis for encopresis is relatively high due to the majority of cases being involuntary.




“Enuresis” is a term for involuntary urination, most frequently experienced as bed-wetting, which affects children and adolescents between the ages of 5 and 17.

Enuresis, the involuntary voiding of urine, is a medical condition most commonly diagnosed in children. There are three subtypes of enuresis. Nocturnal enuresis, or nighttime bed-wetting, is the most common form of enuresis and is more common in boys than in girls. Diurnal enuresis is daytime wetting, which is more common in girls than boys. The third type of enuresis is a combination of nocturnal and diurnal enuresis.

The term “enuresis” describes a specific medical condition and diagnosis. It is important to note that although enuresis has a psychological medical code, children who suffer from enuresis are not considered to be suffering from psychological problems. In order to be diagnosed with enuresis, a person has to have occurrences of involuntary wetting at least twice a week for three months. The individual must be older than the age of anticipated bladder control, usually five years old. The wetting is not due to a general medical condition. “Primary enuresis” refers to children who have never gained control of their bladder. “Secondary enuresis” refers to children who have been successful at bladder control for at least six months but revert to wetting due to stress.
   There is no clear etiology or identified cause of enuresis, but many theories exist. Urinary control is part of the maturing process and nighttime bladder control is the last to develop. Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is by far the most common form of enuresis and has received the most attention from researchers and medical professionals. Genetics may be a factor in NE, as children who have one parent who were bed wetters are 43% more likely to develop NE. Children with both parents who were bed wetters are 77% more likely to develop NE compared to children whose parents did not suffer from NE. Other theories have been proposed to explain NE, such as children who have small bladders, who are deep sleepers, or who have received improper toilet training. However, none of these theories have resulted in any conclusive evidence as to the cause of NE. Researchers agree that there are many factors leading to enuresis.

The percentage of the population with enuresis changes with age. Approximately 20% of five-year-olds have monthly bed-wetting episodes. Bed-wetting decreases to 10% of children aged six years, and of these cases approximately 15% gain bladder control each year. By age 15, 1%–3% of teenagers experience nighttime bed-wetting. From ages four to six the number of boys and girls diagnosed is about equal, with


boys increasing in ratio with age. By age 11 there are approximately twice as many boys as girls suffering from NE.
   Enuresis is often a cause of great stress for families and children. Bed-wetting is associated with low self-esteem in children, which improves as the condition is overcome. An unfortunate but common parental response is to punish or shame a child for bed-wetting. Studies indicate that children rarely wet the bed intentionally, and punitive parental responses are ineffective and often make the condition worse. The most effective treatment is to allow the child to mature as virtually all children outgrow bed-wetting. Other strategies to control NE include the use of bed-wetting alarms which make a loud sound when moisture is detected in order to associate the feeling of a full bladder with waking up. Use of diaper-type underwear made specifically for sleeping has been very helpful in reducing family and child stress.
   Enuresis is a common and stressful problem for many children, adolescents, and their families. Developing a positive approach that avoids shaming is an important consideration in helping a child outgrow enuresis.



Envy and Gratitude is a now famous monograph written by the well-known psychoanalyst Melanie Klein (1882–1960) and published just three years before her death.

In this controversial work, Klein theorized that even infants are torn between the struggle for goodness or





destructiveness, which she defined as gratitude and envy. A controversial and important work, Melanie Klein’s Envy and Gratitude was first published in 1957 at the end of her career. Since its first publishing, this both highly acclaimed and criticized monograph has become a topic of debate and study for psychoanalysts and feminists alike.
   Envy and Gratitude explores Klein’s theory about how infants are torn between the two grounding emotions of the human experience—envy and gratitude. As Klein described it, infants struggle with a primary envy. Therefore, infants must fight a constant battle between the two forces of envy and gratitude, between the “life and death instincts” that all humans face. Largely theoretical in nature, Klein’s views on infant psychosis in Envy and Gratitude led to what is now known as the Kleinian Theory in clinical practice. Unlike other psychoanalysts before her, Klein believed the primal feelings of envy or gratitude are present at the beginning of life. Drawing on her extensive experience with children and developmental psychosis, Klein theorized that a mother’s breast is the first source of this primal feeling of envy or gratitude. In Envy and Gratitude, she describes how a mother’s breast plays a central role in the developmental psyche of infants. As Klein explains it, an infant experiences satisfaction and gratitude by nursing on a mother’s breast—the central object of the infant’s world. In the same way, an infant feels denied and experiences envy
when a mother’s breast is taken away.
   When Envy and Gratitude was first released in 1957, many psychoanalysts criticized Klein’s “wild analytic approach.” However, Klein also drew high praise from psychoanalysts all over the world for her bold views. At her death three years after publishing Envy and Gratitude, Klein was described as “second only to Freud in overall importance to both the science and art of psychoanalysis.”


In the 50th anniversary year of Envy and Gratitude, a group of psychoanalysts published Envy and Gratitude Revisited. This collection of 14 critical essays examines how Klein’s views on envy in the original Envy and Gratitude have influenced the work of


contemporary mental health professionals. Each of these 14 psychoanalysts presented his or her own reflections on Klein’s original work. These authors also gave their own theories of how envy relates to a host of diverse topics, including narcissism, compulsion, jealously, greed, and gender issues. Even 50 years later, Melanie Klein’s timeless work continues to make a significant contribution to the psychoanalytic world. Other notable works by Klein include Love, Guilt and Reparation: And Other Works 1921–1945, The Psychoanalysis of Children, Envy and Gratitude, and Narrative of a Child Analysis.

Envy and jealousy are generally considered negative emotions associated with a person’s desire to have something or someone that someone else already has and not having it feels like a threat to the person’s sense of self.


Envy and jealousy stem from a negative comparison to what someone else has. Envy and jealousy can be over a way of thinking, feeling, or acting or with a tangible item, such as clothes, car, home, and spouse. It includes a resentful awareness of an advantage enjoyed by another joined with a desire to possess the same advantage.
   These two highly negative emotions are often a response to an individual’s belief that someone else has some type of advantage of him or her. These negative emotions can lead to negative self-thoughts by focusing on what others may have or who they may be with. Envy can sometimes be connected to depression and low self-esteem and, when left unchecked, may escalate to destructive or even violent behavior.
   Although from childhood people learn that direct expressions of envy and jealousy can be dangerous, some people find themselves consumed by comparisons. Comparison leads to stress and can depress and divide people. Envy can end up ruining relationships and lives, as well as being highly destructive in the workplace.
   While most Americans tend to think they are beyond class distinctions, Gallup Polls have disproved this assertion. Social class is only one example of social comparison. People compare to evaluate themselves and hope to improve their own self-esteem and status. However, just the opposite is often a result from engaging in such exercises. These thoughts and emotions can end up angering or humiliating the person who focuses on comparisons, and especially those who have more than he or she does.
   Envy and jealousy are synonymous and often are used interchangeably. While they are related, it is important to note the differences between envy and jealousy. Envy is seeing that someone has something or someone that the individual feels the person does not deserve, while jealousy also expresses disappointment.
   Jealousy and envy date back in written history to the Bible and the story of Adam and Eve’s sons, Cain and Abel. Cain and Abel both gave offerings to God, but Cain’s was rejected while Abel’s was received. It is believed that in a jealous rage Cain killed his brother Abel.


   Envy and jealously are sometimes seen with narcissistic personality disorder. Many individuals who have this form of personality disorder believe that others are envious of them. It is important for a narcissist to feel superior to others. Envy and jealousy have also been associated with borderline personality disorder.


Envy and jealousy have often been associated with the color green in English-speaking cultures. Terms such as the “green eyed monster” and “green with envy” have been frequently used popular expressions. The media has played on this with the candy green M&M’s by portraying others as being envious of her. This is also seen in the Disney classic Snow White where the Evil Queen is envious of Snow White’s youth and beauty. She is so overcome with jealousy that she tries to end Snow White’s life.



Epigenetics is the study of changes in genes that do not involve alteration of the genetic code.


• DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a molecule found in all living organisms which contains the blueprints that dictate growth and functioning.
• DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism used by cells to regulate gene expression.





• Epi is a prefix used to mean above, over or in addition to.
• Epigenesis refers to the series of developmental processes an organism goes through. Environmental factors ( diet, weather) can greatly influence this process.
• Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used to make proteins.
• Genes are the carriers of the genetic code present in each cell.
• Genetic code is the sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that is the biochemical basis of heredity (inherited traits).
• Genetics is the scientific study of genes and heredity. It focuses on how living things inherit traits from parents.
• Genotype is one’s genetic makeup and the potential for unique traits or characteristics to develop.
• Nucleotides are the molecular subunits of the nucleic acids, DNA and RNA. Nucleotides transport energy inside a cell.
• Phenotype refers to the observable traits of an organism, such as size, shape, color, and behavior. Phenotype is determined by a combination of gene expression and environmental factors and their interaction.
• Proteins are nutrients used as energy sources (calories) by the body. They are essential components of muscle, skin, and bones.
• RNA is short for ribonucleic acid. It is a group of molecules found in all living organisms that work together to transfer genetic information from DNA to proteins in the cell. RNA play a significant role in the expression of genes.


Epigenetics is the study of factors that influence genetic expression but are not part of the DNA (or gene) sequence. These factors impact the growth and


development of all organisms. Development is shaped by the interaction between genes and the environment. Epigenetic traits occur in addition to, or on top of, genetic traits. Epigenetic processes have the potential to change when, and if, particular genes are activated but do not have any impact on the order of the nucleotides contained in a DNA molecule. Nucleotides are the foundational components of DNA and RNA (nucleic acids). Epigenetic changes can also activate or suppress protein molecules related with DNA. These molecular activities influence the expression of genes that an organism needs to function.
   The term “epigenetics” was originally coined by C. H. Waddington (1905–1975) in 1942 when he combined the words “epigenesis” and “genetics.” Waddington worked in the scientific fields of biology and genetics and believed that both fields should be united. He hypothesized that genes interact with environmental influences to create a particular phenotype. The term “epigenetics” has also been used in the field of psychology. Erik Erikson (1902–1994) used the word in his 1968 book Identity: Youth and Crisis. Erikson believed that an individual’s personality is developed during his or her progression through eight psychosocial stages. Movement through these stages is significantly impacted by environmental factors.
   Epigenetic modifications are affected by stress, nutrition, and self-care during pregnancy. After birth, early developmental (life) experiences have the potential to trigger epigenetic changes that impact the brain, physiology, and behavior. For example, abuse, neglect, and separation from the primary caregiver can result in changes in DNA methylation and gene expression. Epigenetic changes have the potential to affect an individual’s ability to respond and adapt to life experiences that occur early in the developmental process.



Erectile disorder is a mental disorder characterized by the inability to achieve or maintain erections during sexual activities with a partner. It is also known as impotence.


• Acquired erectile disorder means sexual difficulties began occurring after a period of normal sexual functioning.
• Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
• Lifelong erectile disorder means sexual difficulties have been reoccurring since the first sexual encounter.
• Sexual dysfunction disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant difficulty in the ability to respond sexually or to experience sexual pleasure. Disorders include delayed ejaculation, female organismic disorder, and genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.


Erectile disorder is one of the DSM-5 sexual dysfunction disorders characterized by failure to attain or keep penile erection or rigidity when engaging in sexual activities with another person. A thorough medical and sexual history is required to determine how long the problem has been occurring. Additional information regarding relationship, partner, personal, cultural, and medical factors must be obtained.
   The occurrence of this disorder is higher among men over the age of 50. Around 40%–50% of men


aged 60 to 70 and older experience erectile disorder. Approximately 13%–21% of men between the ages of 40 and 50 report occasional erectile difficulties. Approximately 2% of men younger than 40 to 50 years experience significant problems with erections. Although 20% of men are afraid they will have difficulty obtaining and maintaining an erection during their first sexual encounter, only 8% actually experience a problem (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). As a man ages, the probability of experiencing erectile disorder increases.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they experience several symptoms during most sexual encounters, approximately 75%–100% of the time. The problem must occur for a period of at least six months and cause the individual a great deal of distress. The disorder is not the result of mental illness, relationship difficulties, substance abuse, medication side effects, a medical condition, or other stressors. The problem might be situational where the individual might experience erectile disorder only with particular partners, in particular situations, or with specific forms of stimulation. Conversely, the problem might be general in nature, which would indicate it is not attributable to a particular person, situation, or type of stimulation. The problem may have first occurred when the individual initially became sexually active (lifelong) or after a history of normal sexual performance (acquired) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
The cause of this disorder may be attributed to
physical and/or psychological influences. Acquired erectile disorder tends to be ongoing and is associated with biological factors such as heart disease, diabetes, and neurological disorders. Lifelong erectile disorder tends to be intermittent and is associated with psychological factors such as anxiety or use of drugs or alcohol.


Erectile disorder is treated with medication, lifestyle changes, or psychological treatment depending on the type. For acquired erectile disorder, the first step in treatment is to obtain a medical exam to diagnose and





treat underlying health or lifestyle problems that may be contributing to the sexual dysfunction. Then any psychological issues contributing to the sexual problem may be addressed. The lifelong type is typically treatable with psychological treatment interventions. It is used to reduce anxiety and address relationship concerns or other stressors that may influence erectile issues. Both types may also be treated with prescribed medications.


Milton Erickson was an American psychiatrist best known for his pioneering work in clinical hypnosis and family therapy.


Milton Hyland Erickson was born in Aurum, Nevada, on December 5, 1901, and grew up on a farm in Lowell, Wisconsin, with eight siblings. As a child Erickson suffered from dyslexia, was color blind, and tone deaf. At age 17 Erickson contracted the viral infection of polio and was so severely paralyzed that doctors informed his parents that his death was imminent. Although he survived the polio attack, he was left paralyzed and unable to speak. For months all he could


move was his eyes. Observing his family members for hours on end he became vividly aware of the significance of nonverbal communication. He noticed that body language, tone of voice, and other nonverbal expressions often contradicted what people were saying to him. He observed that people could say “yes” but really mean “no” at the same time. During his long recovery Erickson also began to concentrate on “body memories” of muscle movement and was eventually able to regain the ability to talk and use his arms. Erickson developed keen insights into human behavior through these experiences and became very interested in the unconscious mind and hypnosis, a psychological technique used to induce a trance state. When the mind is in a trance, it is an altered mental state of consciousness in which a person experiences heightened concentration with a greater ability to block out distractions. No longer having the strength required to be a farmer like his father Erickson decided to enroll in college. Intending to build up his strength in order to have the health and endurance needed for his studies, Erickson embarked alone on a thousand-mile canoe trip. At first Erickson was able to swim only a few feet and was unable to pull his canoe out of the water. By the end of the trip he was able to swim over a mile and could walk with the use of a cane. Erickson graduated from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine in 1928
as a medical doctor with a degree in psychology.
   After graduating from medical school as a psychiatrist, Erickson worked in psychiatric hospitals and earned a reputation in the psychiatric community for his work in hypnosis. While at Wayne County Hospital in Michigan as director of Psychiatric Research and Training, Erickson conducted extensive research in the therapeutic value of hypnosis. His final medical appointment was as clinical director of the Arizona State Hospital. Erickson retired from hospital work in 1948 due to the progressive effects of polio. In spite of being in constant pain and struggling with the progressive loss of mobility Erickson remained extremely active in teaching, writing, and private practice. He was an associate editor for a medical journal, Diseases of the Nervous System, was a consultant to the U.S. government during World War II studying the effects of propaganda and the psychology of the enemy, and provided hypnosis to the U.S. Olympic Rifle Team who went on

to beat the Russians for the first time. Erickson was the founding president of the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis and established the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, serving as editor for 10 years.
   Erickson is best known for his unique and pioneering approach to hypnosis, which differed from traditional forms of hypnosis in use at the time. Traditional hypnosis was direct and authoritative, but Erickson’s approach was flexible, accommodating, and less direct. Eventually becoming known as Ericksonian hypnosis, Erickson believed that the unconscious mind was always at work, always listening, could be influenced, and contained all of the necessary resources to bring about positive change. He frequently used the imagination, stories, jokes, riddles, and metaphor to communicate to a client’s unconscious mind. He believed that trance states are an everyday common experience that most people are not aware of when they are in a trance state. Being


deep in thought while driving or waiting in line or being lost in a book are examples of trance. Erickson used the naturally occurring trance states clients would be in. He also developed verbal and nonverbal techniques to induce trance in clients. Clients did not have to be consciously aware of the message for the intervention to have an effect. For instance, instead of talking directly and consciously about bed-wetting to a 12-year-old boy struggling with that problem, Erickson used the metaphor of how to throw a baseball. Explaining about the muscle control and timing needed to throw a ball communicated to the child’s subconscious mind what would be needed to stay dry during the night. Erickson also brought greater flexibility to the use of hypnosis and believed that clients were able to find their own unique solutions rather than imposing them on the client.
   Milton Erickson revolutionized the practice of hypnosis and became known as the world’s leading hypnotherapist. Many of his psychotherapeutic strategies have been adopted into mainstream psychotherapies and family therapy. Erickson traveled and lectured extensively; he was a prolific writer authoring several books and over 140 scholarly articles before his death on March 25, 1980.




Erik Erikson was a German American psychologist best known for his theories of psychosocial developmental,





identity formation, and creating the phrase “identity crisis.” He is listed in the top 20 most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.


Erik Erikson was born Erik Salomonsen in Frankfurt, Germany, on June 15, 1902. His mother, Karla Abrahamsen, was Danish and came from a prominent Jewish family in Copenhagen, Denmark. Karla was married to Waldemar Salomonsen but was not living with him when she became pregnant with Erik. Erikson never knew his birth father, or his mother’s first husband, and details of his birth were concealed from him during childhood due to his birth coming from an extramarital relationship. Erikson was adopted by Karla’s second husband, physician Theodor Homberger, and was raised believing that Homberger was his birth father. When Erikson learned the truth of his birth history, he was left with a sense of confusion over who he really was. Erikson was frequently teased by his temple school classmates for being “Nordic” because he was tall with blond hair and blue eyes, which added to his identity confusion. In grammar school he was teased for being Jewish. These childhood experiences led to a lifelong interest in how personal identity is formed and how individuals figure out who they are.
After high school Erikson traveled throughout Europe before entering and graduating from art school. In Vienna, Austria, Erikson taught children of American parents who had come for Freudian psychoanalytic training. During this time he met Anna Freud, Sigmund Freud’s daughter, and received psychoanalysis from her. His experience with Freud and analysis resulted in a deep sense of personal growth and eventually led him to become an analyst himself. Erikson trained at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute. He also studied the Montessori method, an educational approach that focused on a child’s natural self-constructed psychological, physical, and social development. While teaching in Vienna he met Joan Serson, a Canadian dance instructor teaching at the same school as Erikson. They were married in 1930. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, Erikson emigrated to Denmark. In 1933 he moved to the


United States where he changed his name from Erik Homberger to Erik H. Erikson.
   Erikson held teaching positions in several universities, including Harvard Medical School and the University of California at Berkeley. While at Berkeley he began his research into childhood and development by studying the cultural and childrearing practices of the Lakota and Yurok Indian tribes. He also held positions in hospitals, institutes, and child guidance centers as well as maintaining a private practice. During his career he published a number of books addressing theories of identity and development. His books included Childhood and Society (1950), Identity: Youth and Crisis (1968), and Life History and the Historical Moment (1975). His book Gandhi’s Truth (1969) won a Pulitzer Prize and the U.S. National Book Award in Philosophy and Religion.




Erik Erikson, one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century, was best known for his theories of psychosocial development and identity formation. He coined the phrase “identity crisis.” 


  Stages of psychosocial development. Erikson is best known for his theory of the eight stages of psychosocial development. Although trained in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, Erikson rejected Freud’s deterministic beliefs that personality is developed in the context of unconscious aggressive and sexual instincts in childhood. Erikson believed that the environment in which a child developed was essential in the development of self-awareness and identity. Erikson taught that people develop throughout their lifespan and are impacted by social, biological, and psychological factors. As people move through life, they are faced with age-specific challenges and tasks that must be mastered in order for a healthy identify to form. Once a positive identity is formed in one stage, they are able to move to the next stage. When a person is unable to cope with a particular stage, he or she develops a poor self-image which has a negative impact on subsequent stages of development. Erikson identified eight stages of development: Trust versus Mistrust (birth to 1 year old), Autonomy versus Shame and Doubt (1 to 2 years old), Initiative versus Guilt (3 to 5 years old), Industry versus Inferiority (6 to 11 years old), Identity versus Role Confusion (adolescence), Intimacy versus Isolation (early adulthood), Generativity versus Stagnation (middle adulthood), and Integrity versus Despair (later life).
Identity crisis. Erikson coined the phrase “identity
crisis” as a description of what can occur during adolescence when physical, sexual, and cognitive growth is at a maximum. An identity crisis is a time of deep reflection and analysis of oneself as an individual develops a separate and unique self-image and identity from that of his or her parents. It is a time during which an adolescent unifies all that he or she is in terms of temperament, giftedness, body type, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Included in this emergent identity is an appreciation of the many possibilities open to the individual, including the development of personal values, roles, occupational choices, friendships, and sexuality. Successful resolution of the crisis is influenced by the successful resolution of previous stages.
   Erik Erikson made significant contributions to the fields of child development, psychology, psychotherapy, and theories of human development. Erikson was


an influential and pioneering psychoanalyst whose groundbreaking and original developmental theories continue to be taught throughout the psychological, child development, and mental health professions.


Ethics in mental health practice is the moral, legal, and value-based system that guides professional thinking, decisions, and behavior.


• American Counseling Association is the professional organization for the counseling specialties, including school counseling, clinical mental health counseling, career counseling, and rehabilitation professional counselors.
• Involuntary hospitalization is the legal process whereby individuals are placed in inpatient mental health treatment against their will.
• Law is the collection of rules that govern the behavior of individuals in a community, state, or country.
• Morality is the perception of correct and proper behavior, often based on culture or religion.





• Values are principles that govern virtuous behavior. When values are lived or put in action, they are known as virtues.

Ethics guide professional thinking and behavior. It determines how mental health professionals make decisions and conceptualize situations. While ethics is commonly thought of as “doing the right thing,” it is much more complex. Ethics in mental health practice may refer to morality, values, or rules and laws. There are two main types of ethical practice. Mandatory ethics refers to complying with the minimum standards of professional behavior dictated by the law. This is simply following the rules. By contrast, aspirational ethics is the highest form of ethical thinking and behavior. This involves not just following the rules but understanding the principles behind them and striving to embody them in practice.
   There are six principles that form the basis for ethical professional practice. These principles guide ethical thinking and behavior. They are autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice, fidelity, and veracity. Autonomy is the freedom of clients to choose their own direction. Mental health professionals guided by this ethical principle do not force particular treatments or decisions on clients. “Nonmaleficence” means doing no harm to others. This principle prohibits professionals from doing anything that would hurt clients. Such actions may include improper diagnosis or exploitation. “Beneficence” refers to increasing the well-being and good of others. It requires that professionals act to improve their clients’ lives. The ethical principle of justice is being fair and giving equally to others. This includes all individuals regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, disability, socioeconomic status, culture, or other characteristic. “Fidelity” refers to being trustworthy and keeping promises to clients. This is necessary for an effective therapeutic relationship. Finally, “veracity” means truthfulness. Mental health professionals must be open about client rights, risks of treatment, and other factors so clients are well informed.
   All professional mental health organizations have their own specific codes of ethics. These provide guidance on how professionals should behave and they set


forth specific expectations. For example, the Code of Ethics of the American Counseling Association provides guidelines for counselors on topics ranging from confidentiality to social media. These codes also instruct professionals on how to resolve ethical dilemmas. Unethical activity by mental health professionals may include inappropriate relationships with clients, use of improper treatments, or fraud. Many unethical activities are also illegal, such as billing an insurance company for services that were not provided. However, not all unethical activities are illegal. Engaging in a sexual relationship with an adult client is considered unethical but legal. The consequences for unethical professional practice range from mandated supplemental training and supervision to loss of license. These consequences are typically decided by the organization responsible for issuing and overseeing professional licenses.
   In mental health practice, there are often conflicts between different ethical principles For example, a counselor who operates from the principle of beneficence may encourage a client to assert himself or herself to an abusive family member. The intention may be to increase self-esteem and practice healthy communication skills. However, this may result in harm to this client if his or her assertiveness leads to intensified abuse. In this case, the principle of nonmaleficence may have been violated. Another ethical dilemma is presented by the practice of involuntary hospitalization. In this situation, individuals’ right to make their own decisions (autonomy) is taken away because they are deemed unable to care for themselves. This practice may be justified on the grounds that it protects the client from harm (beneficence).


“Ethnicity” refers to a shared distinctive culture based on region of the world, language, religion, and lifestyle.


Our individual identity, our understanding of the world, and the way we act are all heavily influenced by our personal history, including our ethnicity. Ethnicity is usually defined by shared cultural practices, including language, customs, religion, food, and celebrations of life. People of the same ethnicity often celebrate events such as birth, marriage, and death in a similar way. Ethnicity is not race nor is it a nationality. Race usually refers to a person’s physical appearance, such as skin color, eye color, hair color, and bone structure. Nationality is defined by citizenship in a country and many nations are comprised of different ethnic groups. For example, in the United States there are citizens who come from many different ethnic backgrounds.
   Ethnic identity plays a large part in the development of human identity. It is the principal way that people identify themselves with others. It gives individuals a sense of belonging to a particular cultural group. For example, many U.S. citizens with origins in Latin America often identify themselves as Hispanic. People who identify themselves as Hispanic are likely fragmented into smaller groups depending on country of origin and even region or dialect of origin within certain countries.

Current Status and Impact (Psychological Influence)
The values of the ethnic culture in which someone is raised have a big influence on personal ways of thinking and behaving. This especially applies to physical health and self-care. Ethnicity influences the extent to which we can tolerate both physical and psychological pain. This reality provides a challenge for health-care professionals who need to take into account ethnic and multicultural aspects in the treatment of each client.
   The influence of ethnicity also plays a role in keeping people in predetermined social and economic classes. Lack of access to education and resources may


mean that people consume foods that are not nourishing, and this may result in diets high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and carbohydrates. This can in turn lead to chronic health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and stress.
   Many ethnic groups have inherited beliefs and patterns of behavior which may increase their health risks. They may believe that preventive interventions, such as mammograms or colonoscopies, are invasive or indecent. They may believe that seeing a therapist or a counselor means a person is either mentally ill or morally weak. Health-care professionals need to be sensitive to the role that ethnicity can play in the knowledge, acceptance, and use of medical diagnosis, procedures, or interventions.
   Ethnicity and culture are also extremely important factors in the field of caregiving. Cultural biases may lead to the conclusion that someone from the community should be a caregiver who does not have the skills to do it well. Ethnicity can help determine not only the quality and complexity of the caregiving but also the way that caregivers do or do not recognize the stress they are under and the kind of coping mechanisms they use to help them do their work effectively.

• Antioxidants are substances that protect the body from damaging reactive oxygen molecules in the body. These reactive oxygen molecules are thought to play a role in the aging process and the development of degenerative disease.
• Prostaglandins are a group of unsaturated fatty acids involved in the contraction of smooth muscle, control of inflammation, and other body processes.

Evening primrose oil comes from the seed of the evening primrose plant. It is used as a dietary supplement by alternative medical practitioners to relieve the discomfort of symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), eczema, sunburn, fibrocystic breast disease, arthritis, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Other uses are irritable bowel syndrome, peptic ulcer disease, multiple sclerosis, nerve damage related to diabetes, cancer, high cholesterol, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and chronic fatigue syndrome. It has been used in children for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Women use it for PMS, breast pain, and hot flashes. However, clinical studies have shown it to be effective in treating breast pain and osteoporosis. While there is some evidence that it can reduce the symptoms of PMS, Alzheimer’s disease, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, clinical trials have yet to establish its efficacy in these conditions. Evening primrose oil is believed to work because it is a source of essential fatty acids (EFAs). EFAs regulate pain and inflammation and help produce hormone-like substances such as prostaglandins. Evening primrose oil is thought to work by stimulating anti-inflammatory prostaglandins, which helps reduce inflammation and relieve various symptoms.

Evening primrose oil should not be given to patients with epilepsy, and medical supervision is needed if used in children. Evening primrose oil has few reported side effects. Those reported are nausea, headache, and

loose stools. Rarely, bruising of the skin is reported. Evening primrose oil should not be used with Neurontin, Dilantin, or other anticonvulsant medications, since it can lower the threshold for seizures. While other significant drug interactions have yet to be reported, those taking evening primrose oil would do well to mention this to their physicians.


Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex (but Were Afraid to Ask) is a sex manual that was published in 1969 by David Reuben.


The 1960s was an era of social change. This was a period of time that included a sexual revolution. Sex became news and people started talking about sexual experiences and sexual practices more openly than before. Two factors helped create this change. First, the birth-control pill was introduced, which helped women prevent pregnancy after sex. The second was the publication of a groundbreaking study of human sexual responses in 1965 by scientists William H. Masters and Virginia Johnson.
   In a time where sex was being revolutionized, people were interested in learning more. Psychiatrist Dr. David Reuben wrote and published the book Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex (but Were Afraid to Ask). The book was aimed at giving a good amount of information about sexuality in an interesting and informative way. Even in the revolutionary atmosphere of the 1960s, the content of the book was still shocking to many. This was because of its honest discussion of sex acts, sexual positions, and group sex. The book is also detailed and provides good information on male and female sexual anatomy. It quickly became a national and international best seller. In that same year director and filmmaker Woody Allen produced a movie with the same name. The film contained scenarios based roughly around the content of the book. But it also aimed at highlighting the funny side of some of


the basic sexual practices it described. The movie was also a success, both commercially and critically.

There are some significant cultural impacts associated with the book Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex (but Were Afraid to Ask). It was one of the most popular nonfiction books of its era in the United States and internationally. Its openness and material had a profound effect on sex education and changed cultural attitudes toward sex. Despite the initial shock of some people, the book was successful and had many imitators. One such work was The Joy of Sex, an illustrated manual published in 1972. Reuben’s book helped support and encourage new ways that people wrote, thought, and talked about sex.
   Due to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS in the1980s and 1990s, critiques of the book emerged. Some believed it did not address the psychological effects of the social and moral changes it supported. In addition, the book presented information only on heterosexual relations. The book was not overtly negative to other viewpoints; it just did not include them. The book also received criticism for being overly optimistic about sexual relations and about sexual identity itself. It was revised and republished in 1999 to address some of these issues.



Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a form of practice that is based on the integration of the best research evidence with clinical expertise and client values.

• Accountability is the expectation or requirement to conduct evaluations and report performance information.
• Best practice is a method that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means, and that is used as a benchmark.
• Empirically supported treatments are therapeutic interventions that research demonstrates to be effective in facilitating therapeutic change.
• Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) is an organization that provides or arranges managed care.
• Managed care is a system of health care that controls costs by placing limits on physicians’ fees and by restricting access to certain medical procedures and providers.
• Practice is a method or process used to accomplish a goal or objective.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Randomized controlled trial is a research design in which participants are assigned randomly (by chance) to an experimental treatment or one that receives a comparison treatment or placebo. It is also known as randomized clinical trials.
• Treatment is a technique used to promote health and well-being, often implemented after a diagnosis is formulated.

Evidence-based practice is similar to the concept of best practices. Both aim to increase accountability of health-care practices. EBP in psychotherapy integrates the findings of scientific research with clinician expertise and client needs and preferences (values).


“Evidence-based practice” refers to the therapeutic process a psychotherapist chooses, when those choices are informed by research evidence.
   Evidence-based practice is similar to but different from empirically supported treatments (ESTs). EBP may include ESTs, but it is larger in scope than treatments. EBP involves specific interventions (practices) used to bring about therapeutic change. More specifically, to merit that designation, ESTs demonstrated that they are superior to a placebo treatment in two or more randomized controlled studies, equivalent to a well-established treatment in several rigorous and independent controlled studies, or (3) effective in a large series of single-case controlled studies. Clearly, the extent of research support for EBP is significantly less than that for ESTs.

Prior to the 1990s, there were no specific guidelines for either clinicians or consumers regarding which treatments to select for which conditions. In 1993, a task force of the American Psychological Association developed a set of criteria for “empirically validated treatments.” Later these treatment came to be known as ESTs. However, there has been considerable controversy about ESTs. Some believe that the controlled context of scientific research cannot be replicated in clinical practice. Others contend that the results of scientific study are generalizable to clinical contexts. For the past two decades this debate has been fueled by the increasing expectation for accountability. Increasingly, medical and psychological practice has become more accountable and evidence based. In response, many have championed EBP as an alternative to ESTs.
   EBP is a form of practice informed by scientific research. It also includes clinical judgment and client values. EBP in medicine was defined by the Institute of Medicine (2001) as “the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values.” The American Psychological Association (2005) modified that definition as “the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture and preferences.” The challenge for the clinician is to





plan and implement treatment that balances all three: research, clinical expertise, and client characteristics. This challenge is very real as reimbursement for non-EBP clinical services is less likely. Insurance companies are increasingly demanding that clinicians provide evidence for the empirical basis underlying treatment as a condition for reimbursement for services. This fact has created an effort to conduct medical and psychological practice in the most efficient manner possible. EBP is largely about the effort to get the best results for less money and in the shortest amount of time. While EBP was not officially introduced until the 1990s, the effort was



Evil

largely inspired in the 1970s with the implementation of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).

HMOs were the first federally legislated form of managed care. Managed care was established to increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of health care. EBP can and does have a critical role in managed care.
   EBP is about making informed choices in clinical practice to increase the probability of therapeutic outcomes. It increases consistency in therapy and assists in making the best possible therapeutic choice. EBP is largely based on clinician intuition as a result of several factors: there is an absence of research available for many practice concerns; every client has unique characteristics, values, and preferences; and the clinical expertise of the clinician effects therapeutic outcomes in a unique way. Clinical decision making is a very real challenge that is rendered more consistent and effective through the use of EBP.

In the psychological sense, “evil” refers to the capacity of a human being or group of human beings, who appear to be ordinarily good people, to transform and begin acting in ways that are intentionally harmful, cruel, or abusive.

Definitions
• “Banality of evil” is a phrase used by political theorist Hannah Arendt to describe the mindless actions of high-ranking Nazi figure Adolf Eichmann, an unremarkable figure who engaged in atrocious crimes against countless numbers of Jews for senseless reasons.
• “Lucifer Effect” is a term coined by psychologist Philip Zimbardo as a result of his Stanford Prison Experiment to explain how ordinary, decent people were capable of inflicting harm and abuse on others when the situation perpetuated it.
• Obedience studies (“Milgram’s Experiments”), led by psychologist Stanley Milgram during the early 1960s, articulated the salience of real or perceived authority at influencing a human being’s thoughts, values, and actions.
• Stanford Prison Experiment, conducted by a team of psychologists at Stanford University in 1971, evidenced how powerful situational factors could be in changing individual thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and behaviors.


People have been interested in the concept of evil for centuries. Theologians, philosophers, and psychologists alike have questioned how evil develops as well as its effect on human behavior, relationships, and on society as a whole. Debate has ensued regarding both biological and environmental factors that contribute to evil. “Evil” is a negative term that describes disdainful, violent, cruel, or abusive characteristics or actions. It has a religious connotation and is historically associated with Lucifer, God’s fallen angel. Originally God’s favorite, most beloved angel, Lucifer fell from grace and was cast into Hell after challenging God’s authority. He was then referred to as either “Satan” or the “Devil.” Given this explanation, people now use the word “evil” to describe a characteristic transformation from positive to negative: good to bad, right to wrong, helpful to harmful, decent to monstrous.

Psychologist Stanley Milgram’s obedience studies were some of the first to reveal how normal, mentally well people could inflict severe harm (via electric shock) on innocent victims simply because they were instructed to do so. Philip Zimbardo extended on this research conducting the famous Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971. After being assessed for mental and physical health, 24 males were selected for the study. These participants, half designated guards and the other half prisoners, were placed in a mock prison environment for a period of one to two weeks. Researchers remained on site to record daily events by videotape. The “guards” were instructed to maintain order and keep the “prisoners” in line. The prisoners were subjected to a typical incarceration situation, confined three to a cell, given limited mobility and privileges, and required to follow the established rules. After just six days the experiment had to be shut down after it became apparent that the interactions among participants were getting out of control. Guards abused their power, treating prisoners in harmful, degrading, and abusive manners and the prisoners exhibited signs of acute distress and anxiety. Study findings suggested that even good, decent people could turn to evil ways if the


situation encouraged it. Zimbardo termed this the “Lucifer Effect” and went onto publish a New York Times best seller with the same title in 2007. This launched national interest on the topic of evil, questioning what factors either promote or diminish abusive, harmful actions and allow them to perpetuate. Lessons learned from the Stanford Prison experiment have been cited in cases involving violent, abusive tactics, brainwashing, manipulation, and mind control.

Instances of human evil such as racial, gender, and sexual prejudice have been evident throughout history. Matters of war and acts of terrorism promote hated, loathing, retaliation, and retribution. In particular, heinous crimes of genocide (ethnic cleansing) articulate evil. The Holocaust in one of the most fundamental examples of pure evil. The Nazi regime was successful in annihilating millions of Jews during World War II, an unimaginable human atrocity. More recently, in 2003–2004, U.S. military personnel of the army and Central Intelligence Agency were found to have engaged in acts of abuse and torture toward Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib Prison, spawning outrage, criticism, and concern.
   Research investigating acts of abuse and oppression have noted that evil does not happen in a vacuum. Psychologists Thomas Carnahan and Sam McFarland suggest that creating a dynamic that perpetuates an “us” against “them” mentality may allow for evil, tyrannical acts to occur more readily. Though it was once believed that the evil characteristic appears out of thin air in normal, well-adjusted people, further investigation into the Milgram and Stanford Prison studies have revealed that participants who inflicted harm on others scored higher in aggression, authoritarianism, narcissism, and dominance and lower in empathy and altruism. Psychologists have long described a “dark triad of personality” that includes narcissism, Machiavellianism (willingness to manipulate situations or others for personal gain), and psychopathy (antisocial behavior and lack of empathy). A fourth dark trait has been added, sadism, or gaining pleasure from inflicting harm or pain on others, as a result of these studies’ findings.


Evolutionary psychology (EP) is an approach to psychology that incorporates principles from evolutionary biology into an understanding of human behavior.

• Evolution is a theory first proposed by Charles Darwin that states all species and organisms develop and change through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the ability of the species or organism to compete, survive, and reproduce.
• Evolutionary time refers to an unspecified amount of time usually in the hundreds of thousands to millions of years.
• Natural selection is a process by which an organism or species best adapted to an environment is able to survive longer and reproduce in greater numbers, with the adaptive traits being passed down to the next generation. As the number of adapted offspring increases, there is an ever-decreasing chance for the less adapted organism to reproduce eventually resulting in the extinction of the less adaptive traits.

Evolutionary psychology is not a specific method of psychotherapy but rather an approach to understanding human behavior based on the principles of evolution, adaptations, and natural selection. Evolutionary


psychologists hold that EP is not a subdiscipline of psychology but rather a biologically informed framework that encompasses all fields of understanding human behavior. Psychologists agree that human behavior is the result of internal psychological mechanisms that take place within the human brain. Most fields of psychology have a perspective or theory on what the specific internal mechanisms are and how they operate. For instance, cognitive psychology explains human behavior in terms of cognitive structures (how we think) and the impact of these thoughts on feelings and behaviors. What distinguishes evolutionary psychologist from other schools of thought is the belief that the internal psychological mechanisms are actually evolutionary adaptations produced through natural selection as our ancestors lived, reproduced, and died throughout evolutionary time.
   One of the major goals of EP is to identify emotional and cognitive adaptations that have evolved and which characterize the psychological nature of human beings. EP focuses almost exclusively on how the brain has evolved and how it generates emotions and behavior. According to EP, natural selection has resulted in psychological adaptations within the brain producing universal frames of meaning (true across all cultures) in how humans interpret events; experience emotion; mate and reproduce; and make meaning of other’s behaviors and form social relationships, to name a few.
   EP consists of several core principles that link psychology, evolutionary biology, and brain functioning. The first principle is that the brain is a physical system designed to process information and produce behavior. The brain is governed by electrochemical reactions, which function like organic neural computer circuits and which determine how it processes information. Second, the neural circuits were established through natural selection in order to solve problems. These problems were recurring and had to do with mating, parenting, social dynamics, motivation, and cognitive development. Third, most brain functions and problem solving are unconscious and involve extremely complex neural circuitry. Fourth, natural selection has produced specialized parts of the brain for solving specific types of problems. The final principle is that our modern human skulls house a Stone Age brain. The human brain has evolved over millions of years and only the





smallest fraction of time has been lived in a modern society. For 10 million years natural selection has formed the human brain to solve hunter-gatherer problems of living. The modern computer age is less than 30 years old, the industrial revolution began only 200 years ago, and agriculture first appeared only about 10,000 years ago. There have not been enough generations for the brain to develop circuits adapted to our postindustrial society. Evolutionary psychologists believe that the key to understanding how the modern human mind works is to understand that it has not evolved to solve modern problems.
   EP is a new approach to understanding human behavior that blends evolutionary biology and psychology to gain a deeper insight into the human mind. EP can be applied to fields such as social psychology, cognitive psychology, and personality theory.

Excoriation disorder is a mental disorder characterized by recurrent picking at one’s own skin.

• Acceptant and commitment therapy is a type of psychotherapy that helps individuals


accept the difficulties that come with life. It is a form of mindfulness-based therapy. It is also known as ACT.
• Antiseizure medications are prescription drugs used to treat epilepsy (seizures) as well as burning, stabbing, and shooting pain. It is also called anticonvulsant medications.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing faulty behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as CBT.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are a group of DSM-5 disorders characterized by preoccupations and repetitive behaviors. They include obsessive-compulsive disorder, hoarding disorder, and excoriation disorder.
• Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental disorder characterized by unwanted and repeated thoughts and feelings (obsessions) or behaviors that one feels driven to perform (compulsions). It is commonly referred to as OCD.

Excoriation (skin picking) disorder is one of the DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. It is characterized by the recurrent urge to pick at one’s own skin, often to the extent that damage occurs. Individuals may pick for several reasons. They may pick when they are anxious or bored or during times when they aren’t even aware they are picking. They may pick to cope with negative emotions (e.g., sadness, anger, and anxiety) or in response to tension and stress. When picking their skin, individuals often experience a sense of relief, which may be followed with feelings of guilt and shame.
   The most common sites that individuals pick are the arms, hands, and face; however, many individuals





pick from many different sites on the body. Individuals with this disorder pick at pimples, scabs, and even healthy skin. Most pick their skin with their fingernails, while others may use pins or tweezers and others even bite their skin. Some individuals may search for a particular kind of scab to pick and may examine, play with, and even eat the skin after it has been pulled. Some individuals spend several hours a day picking their skin, and this can lead to significant distress in their life, particularly with occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. For example, students may miss school and have difficulty studying and completing assignments because of skin picking.
   Individuals with this disorder often feel a sense of loss of control and embarrassment. Individuals usually pick their skin in private or sometimes in front of family members. Individuals may avoid social situations as well as going out in public due to the shame of skin picking. Most individuals with this disorder hide their scars and lesions by concealing it with makeup or wearing clothing that hides the area of skin that has been damaged. Skin picking can be very severe and lead to tissue damage, scarring, infection, and life-threatening conditions. Infections may require antibiotic treatment and in some cases may require surgery. Excoriation is more common among females and may present at any age, although it is most common during the onset of puberty (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they have engaged in recurrent picking of their own skin resulting in skin lesions. Individuals must have had repeated attempts to decrease or stop picking. This behavior must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning. Distress with this disorder refers to a loss of control, shame, and embarrassment. Significant impairment with this behavior includes several areas of functioning, such as social, educational, occupational, and leisure. The skin picking behavior cannot be a result of any physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Skin picking behavior cannot be better explained by symptoms of any other mental disorder
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
   The exact causes of this disorder are unknown. Environmental factors may play a role in excoriation


disorder. For example, individuals who grew up in families who engaged in and witnessed skin picking may be more prone to developing this disorder. Biological factors may also play a role. For example, the disorder is passed down from parents to children. Another possible cause of excoriation disorder may be a coping mechanism for individuals to deal with turmoil and stress within them, and these individuals have an impaired stress response. Skin picking behavior may also result from repressed rage felt by overbearing parents. These individuals often have other psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression. Excoriation disorder is more common in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Excoriation disorder and OCD share several of the same features. For example, individuals with skin picking disorder will pick their skin over and again, often in response to recurrent thoughts or urges to pick their skin. OCD is also characterized by urges to engage in repetitive behaviors (rituals) in response to recurrent thoughts and impulses.

Treatment for this disorder typically involves psychotherapy and medication. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been found to help individuals with skin picking disorder. The goal of CBT is to have an individual focus on and change his or her thoughts and behaviors. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has also been shown to be effective. ACT theorizes that greater well-being can be attained by overcoming negative thoughts and feelings. The goal of ACT is to have an individual look at his or her character traits and behaviors that will assist in reducing avoidant coping styles. ACT also focuses on individuals making a commitment to behavior changes. Some antidepressant medications (e.g., SSRIs, such as Prozac) are often prescribed and are effective in treating this disorder. Antiseizure medicines, such as Lamictal, are also being used for this disorder.



Executive functions are high-level cognitive abilities such as planning, organizing, reasoning, decision making, and problem solving that influence more basic abilities such as attention, memory, and motor skills.


• Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a disorder of the nervous system characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness.
• Autism spectrum disorders are disorders with impaired ability to communicate and interact socially and with repetitive behaviors or restricted interests (e.g., autism and Asperger’s syndrome).
• Learning disabilities are disorder characterized by difficulty with skills such as reading or writing in individuals with normal intelligence.
• Tourette’s syndrome is a disorder of the nervous system, characterized by a variable expression of tics (unwanted movements and noises).


Executive functions are the cognitive process that regulates an individual’s ability to organize thoughts and activities, prioritize tasks, manage time efficiently, and make decisions. Those with executive function problems are likely to have difficulty planning a project, difficulty anticipating how much time a project will


take to complete, trouble communicating details in an organized, sequential manner, difficulty with the mental strategies involved in memorization and retrieving information from memory, trouble initiating activities or tasks, or difficulty retaining information while doing something with it, such as remembering a phone number while dialing. Impairment of executive function is noted in a range of disorders, including attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, Tourette’s syndrome, and learning disabilities.

In the 1980s, the American psychologist Michael Posner (1936–) and his colleagues influenced recent research into executive functions. He identified a separate “executive” branch of cognitive function responsible for focusing attention. Because individuals with deficits in executive functioning have difficulty with learning in school and job performance, the assessment of executive function is common. There is no single test or battery (series) of tests that identifies all aspects of executive function. For that reason, psychologists and learning disorder specialists use various tests. Some of the most common are the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Stroop Color and Word Test, and the Color-Word Interference Test.
Wisconsin card sorting test. This test measures
the ability to shift cognitive strategies in response to changing environmental contingencies as well as the ability to develop and maintain an appropriate problem-solving strategy across changing stimulus conditions. It consists of 128 response cards and 4 stimulus cards that depict figures of varying forms, colors, or numbers of figures.
Stroop color and word test. This test is used to assess cognitive flexibility in the sense of ability to inhibit a more automatic verbal response (reading color words) in order to generate a conflicting response of naming the dissonant ink colors.
Color-word interference test. This test assesses
cognitive flexibility by requiring the test-taker to inhibit reading words standing for colors while naming the colors themselves. It then asks the test-taker to switch back and forth between naming the dissonant (wrong) ink color and reading the conflicting word.



Exhibitionistic disorder is a mental health disorder that is characterized by the exposure of one’s genitals to others in order to gain sexual satisfaction.


• Antiandrogens are medications that block male sex hormones.
• Aversion therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on reducing or avoiding an undesirable pattern in an individual by conditioning that individual to associate the behavior with an undesirable stimulus.
• Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also known as CBT.
• DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
• Hormones are chemical substances produced in the body that control and regulate the activity of certain cells or organs.

• Testosterone is a hormone that influences the sexual drive in both men and women.
• Twelve-Step Program is a self-help group whose members attempt recovery from various addictions and compulsions on a plan called the Twelve Steps.


Exhibitionistic disorder is one of the DSM-5 paraphilic disorders. It is characterized by the compulsion to expose one’s genitals to other individuals (usually strangers) in order to gain sexual satisfaction. The exhibitionist usually does not have the intention of further sexual activity with the other individual. Some exhibitionists have a desire to shock or upset the individual, while other exhibitionists fantasize that the individual (target) will become sexually aroused by their display. In some instances, the exhibitionist masturbates while exposing himself or herself to the individual. Some symptoms associated with exhibitionistic disorder include an individual having recurrent fantasies of exposing himself or herself but rarely or never acting on the fantasies. Other individuals have difficulty controlling urges and have exposed themselves to at least three individuals. Another aspect of this disorder is impulse control.
   According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they have intense and recurrent arousal from exposing one’s genitals to an unsuspecting individual. This must occur for a period of at least six months as demonstrated by urges, behaviors, and fantasies. An individual can be diagnosed with this disorder if he or she has acted on sexual urges with a non-consenting individual. The sexual urges must cause significant distress or impairment in occupational, social, or other meaningful areas of functioning. If the individual is living in a controlled environment (e.g., institution) to restrict his or her exhibitionistic behavior, the specifier “In a controlled environment” must be included in the diagnosis. An individual who has not acted on urges with a non-consenting individual and has not had any distress or impairment for at least five years in social, occupational, or other areas of important functioning, the specifier “In full remission” must be included in the diagnosis. There are three subtypes for exhibitionistic disorder listed in the DSM-5 that are based on physical maturity, age, of the non-consenting individuals (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
The exact cause of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown. However, there are a number of theories about its origin or cause. One theory is biological and assumes that as testosterone increases in males so does deviant sexual behaviors. Some medications are prescribed to exhibitionists in order to lower their testosterone levels. Another theory is that emotional abuse caused by growing up in a dysfunctional family poses significant risk factors in developing exhibitionist disorder. It is also thought that exhibitionists regard their mothers as rejecting them based on their different genitals. Therefore, they grow up with a desire to force women to accept them by making women look at


their genitals. Antisocial personality disorders, alcohol abuse, and pedophilic interest may be considered risk factors for exhibitionist disorder in males with exhibitionist preferences. The prevalence of exhibitionist disorder is higher in men than among women (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).


Treatment for this disorder usually includes a combination of psychotherapy, medications, and other treatments. Several different forms of psychotherapy have been found to be effective in treating exhibitionistic disorder. In particular, cognitive behavior therapy has been found to help individuals diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder. Individuals are encouraged to recognize irrational behaviors and to change other distorted patterns of thinking. Aversion therapy is another form of method used for treating individuals with exhibitionistic disorder. This type of therapy involves asking the individual to fantasize about specific events that led to exhibitionism. A very unpleasant scene is inserted into the events. For example, an individual might be asked to imagine an undercover agent approaching as the individual is exposing himself or herself or imagining his or her target laughing at him or her. Another treatment method that is often used for individuals with exhibitionistic disorder is social skills training. It is believed that some men develop paraphilias partly because they never developed health relationships with other individuals. The relationships may be either sexual or nonsexual. Twelve-Step Programs for sexual addicts may be another method of treatment. Exhibitionists often feel guilty and anxious about their behavior and are often helped by the social support available in Twelve-Step Programs.
Several different medications are prescribed and
used to treat an individual with exhibitionistic disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are medications often used in treating paraphilia’s. SSRIs have been found to be effective because, as the levels of serotonin increase in the brain, the sex drive decreases. Female hormones (estrogen) are also used to treat individuals with exhibitionistic disorder. The hormone used in treating this disorder works by stimulating the liver, which produces a chemical that clears





testosterone from the bloodstream. Antiandrogens are also used. These medications block the uptake of testosterone and reduce the blood levels of testosterone and significantly reduce repetition of the deviant behavior. Removal of the testes, surgical castration, is another treatment option for exhibitionists. This procedure reduces the levels of testosterone in the blood, thus decreasing the sex drive. This form of treatment, however, is generally used for serious sexual offenders, such as violent rapists and pedophiles.



Existential psychotherapy (EP) is an experiential and relationship-oriented approach to psychotherapy that focuses on meaning and the nature of the human experience.


Existential psychotherapy focuses on the nature of the human condition, the capacity for self-awareness, and the freedom to choose one’s own fate. Individuality, freedom, autonomy, personal responsibility, and the search for meaning are key concepts. The goals in existential counseling are to help individuals become aware of their own possibilities and to recognize that they are responsible for both positive and negative events that take place in their lives. This method of


psychotherapy is less focused on technique and more focused on understanding freedom and responsibility, meaning and meaninglessness, isolation and relationships, and living and dying. Existential psychotherapy is a philosophical approach to helping and is well suited to individuals with existential concerns such as life transitions, making sense of life, disappointments in life, discovering values, and seeking self-expression and self-fulfillment. Existential therapy can be provided in individual or group counseling sessions.


Existential psychotherapy is deeply rooted in existential philosophy, which was developed over many years and was not founded by any one individual. Both 19th and 20th-century philosophers influenced existentialism. Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), Martin Heidegger (1889–1976), and Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) are some of the early philosophers who made significant contributions to the movement. More recently, contemporary existential psychotherapy has been highly influenced by the work of Viktor Frankl, Rollo May, James Bugental, Otto Frank, and Irvin Yalom. All of these therapists individually contributed to the development of existential psychotherapy.
   Existential psychotherapy does not rely on any specific techniques. EP is based on the understanding and exploration of what it means to be human. The existential perspective is that human beings are in a constant state of transition and continually need to re-create and find meaning in existence. Assisting people in finding a balance between the difficulties, tragedies, and dilemmas of being human and discovering the opportunities, possibilities, and meaning in the human experience is a fundamental aspect of the approach.
The core dimensions of EP include the following:
(1) People have the ability to be self-aware, which leads to greater awareness of potential, motivation, and alternatives in living. (2) People are free to choose and are responsible to shape their own destinies. (3) People must develop the courage to create their own self-identity in order to authentically relate to others.
(4) People search for significance, meaning, and purpose in life, which are discovered through engagement





with what is valued. (5) Anxiety is unavoidable and can lead to change. (6) Awareness of the inevitability of death provides the motivation to live life fully with meaning and significance.

Existential psychotherapy is a here-and-now approach that focuses on what people are becoming, not on past experiences or childhood dynamics. A meaningful and authentic relationship between the client and therapist is essential with the understanding that both may be changed by the encounter. The central goal of EP is to help people become aware of their possibilities, understand their own freedom and responsibility in making choices, and identify what is keeping them from living a meaningful life.
   EP is more a style and philosophy of psychotherapy than a specific model of therapy. The lack of techniques unique to EP has resulted in an approach that is difficult to research and suffers from a lack of evidence-based treatment outcomes. Other criticisms of the existential approach include its lack of training models and language and concepts that can be perceived as mystical and vague. A significant limitation to EP is the level of philosophical knowledge required of the practitioner and a deep understanding of what it means to be human.
   Existential psychotherapy is a philosophical and experiential approach to helping. EP is provided through an authentic relationship that assists individuals in developing the courage to finding meaning and significance in life while facing the realities of life.


Expertise is the special knowledge or skills in a particular subject area learned from experience resulting in a high level of proficiency or competency.


• Attitude is the predisposition or tendency to respond positively or negatively to specific ideas, individuals, or situations.
• Competency is the capacity to integrate knowledge, skills, and attitudes reflected in the quality of clinical counseling practice.
• Deliberate practice is the effort and time devoted to reaching for objectives just beyond one’s level of proficiency (skills) and using interventions to increase one’s proficiency.
• Expert refers to one who practices with a high level of expertise or proficiency.
• Knowledge is information about various topics that includes definitions and explanations of processes that explain larger constructs.
• Master therapists are psychotherapists who are considered by fellow therapists to be “the best of the best” in terms of expertise in psychotherapy. They are also called expert therapists.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Reflective practice is a process that expert therapists utilize in which they continue to learn from experiences and increase their capacity to work effectively with clients.
• Second-order change is long-lasting change that can be achieved in counseling when clients experience symptom or conflict reduction and long-lasting personality change.
• Skills are capacities that can be acquired (learned) through education and “hands-on” training.





• 10,000 hours rule is the rule based on the research finding that at least 10,000 hours of deliberate practice are required to achieve expertise in a given occupation.

“Expertise” refers to the characteristic way in which experts think and act. It distinguishes the performance of experts from the less experienced. When it comes to psychotherapy, expert therapists are also called master therapists. These individuals have an advanced ability to quickly assess situations and easily design appropriate treatment interventions. They have the ability to quickly determine when treatment interventions are not effective and can modify treatment very efficiently compared to their peers. They engage in lifelong learning and continue to learn the nuances of working with clients through additional training and reflective practice. Expert therapists have the ability to engage their clients in highly effective therapy to ultimately achieve treatment goals and effect change with their clients in a relatively short amount of time.
   Psychologist Anders Ericsson (1947–) has pioneered the study of expertise. Based on his research he has proposed the 10,000 hours rule. He reports that it takes 10,000 hours for the brain to assimilate a particular skill. This 10,000 rule also applies to counselor development. The beginner or novice counselor engages in reflective and deliberate counseling practice that will lead to more advanced counseling skills, knowledge, and attitudes. It should be noted that 10,000 hours of the same practice without learning from experience does not result in expertise.
   Expertise has been studied in various professions and among specific behaviors such as violinists, chess players, educators, and athletes. Experts are characterized by being highly skilled in a particular skill area. Expert or master therapists are more effective and are able to navigate the nuances of working with individuals in psychotherapy. The process of expertise begins with the beginner stage, advanced beginner, minimally competent, proficient, and finally the expert stage.
   Beginning therapists possess a very limited capacity to assess, analyze, and intervene. They are overly reliant on basic principles and techniques and


are rule-bound, but they are very inexperienced and need supervision. Advanced beginners possess some capacity for assessment or diagnosis, and application of interventions, but they experience difficulty generalizing this capacity to different patients and new situations. They require clinical supervision and additional training in most counseling functions. Therapists in the minimally competent developmental stage hold the capacity to function independently but with a minimal competence and minimal effectiveness. They are able to cope with and handle crises or other problems as they arise and are able to integrate theory and research in most aspects of their practice. Proficient therapists have the capacity to function independently and effectively. Their performance is guided by flexibility and a clear understanding of their clients’ personalities and patterns. They are able to integrate their personal with their professional life and values. The expert or master therapist has an intuitive grasp of clinical situations and is able to very efficiency work with clients on reducing symptoms and effecting lasting change or second-order change. Therapists who function at the expert or mastery stage spend a significant amount of time in training, supervision, and reflective practice.
Expert therapists practice and display high levels
of the following competencies: clinical competence, ethical competence, cultural competence, social interest, and well-being or self-care. Clinical competency is evidenced by clinical intuition and judgment shown by clinicians based on their clinical knowledge, skills, and attitudes and reflection on those experiences as they relate to the specific circumstances of a particular patient. Cultural competency is the clinicians’ awareness of cultural variables in themselves and in their clients that may affect the therapeutic relationship and treatment process. Ethical sensitivity is the capacity to recognize, anticipate, and respond to the suffering and vulnerability of those receiving professional services, especially among ethical and moral aspects. Social interest is the clinician’s orientation of connecting to other human beings and searching for a sense of purpose through helping others and empowering clients to enhance their own sense of social interest. Lastly, expert counselors are usually able to balance work and personal life while actively engaging in self-care practices to maintain their own emotional, social, and physical well-being.





   Based on his research Thomas Skovholt (1944) described the attributes of master therapists. He discussed qualitative research and interviews about master therapists. He identified that mastery is achieved through an ongoing effort to improve skills, being open to feedback from supervisors, seeking new knowledge through continuing education and training, and significant clinical experience, which is a given. Skovholt and Jennings identified 11 characteristics of the ideal therapist, and they suggest that master therapists possess		
many of these traits: master therapists are voracious

learners, they use their accumulated experiences, they value cognitive complexity and ambiguity, they have emotional receptivity, they are healthy and nurture their own emotional well-being, they are aware of how their emotional health affects their work, they possess highly developed relational skills, they cultivate strong working alliances with clients, they excel in using their exceptional therapy skills, they trust their clients, and they are culturally competent (Jennings and Skovholt, 1999). These attributes were found among their qualitative research done among master therapists.
   In summary, master or expert therapists demonstrate high levels of clinical, ethical, and cultural expertise, social interest, and self-care. They have significant relational skills and are able to form very effective therapeutic alliances with clients. Research identifies that mastery takes approximately 10,000 hours with deliberate and reflective practice. Master therapists are able to quickly effect long-lasting change with clients in a relatively short amount of time. Understanding traits of master therapists informs graduate counseling and psychology programs about important competencies and processes that can influence competent trainees.


Exposure therapy is a behavior therapy intervention (method) in which a client is exposed to a feared object or situation. It is also referred to as flooding.

• Behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors. It is also referred to as behavioral therapy.
• Classical conditioning is an involuntary process of neurological change in response to a stimulus that causes a reaction. Classical conditioning occurs when the involuntary reaction is associated (paired) to a new unrelated stimulus causing the reaction to occur automatically when the new stimulus is present. It is also known as Pavlovian conditioning.
• In vivo is a Latin term that means “in the living” and signifies therapeutically that an intervention is occurring in real life, as opposed to in an imagination or in a theory.
• Pathology is an experience of suffering or aspect of a disease incorporating cause, development, structure, and consequences.
• Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
• Reciprocal inhibition is a therapeutic technique that obstructs the presence of one response through the introduction of an opposite response.





• Relaxation training a progressive tensing and relaxing of specific muscle groups to teach acceptance and letting go of anxious symptoms.
• Systematic desensitization is a form of exposure therapy that gradually exposes an individual to his or her phobia while teaching him or her to stay relaxed in the increasing presence of his or her phobia. It is also known as graduated exposure therapy.
• Virtual reality exposure therapy is form of exposure therapy that uses computer-generated imagery to expose a client to simulations of a dreaded object or event.


Exposure therapy is a behavior therapy intervention in which the therapist intentionally exposes a client to a feared object or situation. Exposure therapy is based on the premise that confronting dreaded objects or situations results in a reduction of distress. A variety of psychotherapeutic techniques are available in exposure therapy. The basic technique utilized in exposure therapy is called in vivo exposure. In vivo exposure therapy requires that the client be exposed to his or her dreaded object or situation in real life. For example, a therapist could bring real live spiders into a counseling session with a client who suffers from arachnophobia (fear of spiders). Another form of exposure therapy is imaginal exposure, which instructs a client to imagine being in the presence of a dreaded object or situation. As in the previously given example, a client with arachnophobia would be instructed to imagine spiders or situations involving spiders. Research evidence and clinical experience suggest that imaginal exposure is not as therapeutically effective as in vivo exposure therapy. A type of imaginal exposure therapy occurs with the assistance of virtual reality technologies. As a result of advancements in computer-generated imagery, virtual reality exposure therapy can be as effective as in vivo therapy. Interoceptive exposure is a type of exposure therapy that exposes a client to sensations that typically occur with exposure to his or her feared object or situation.


If a client suffering from arachnophobia has a symptom of shortness of breath (hyperventilation) when exposed to spiders, the therapist using interoceptive exposure therapy might suggest that the client breathe through a straw or into a paper bag to expose the client to the sensation without spiders present. If the client hyperventilates on being exposed to spiders, then exposure to hyperventilation without spiders present eventually reduces or removes the fear of the symptom and often alters the involuntary response (hyperventilation) to the classically conditioned stimulus (spiders). The fear response to a particular stimulus is replaced with a relaxation response to the same stimulus.
   Exposure therapy is similar to but different from systematic desensitization. Both exposure therapy and systematic desensitization are therapeutic techniques that focus on the extinction (removal) of a conditioned response. Exposure therapy (flooding) encourages a patient to confront a fear and refrain from reacting in a typical manner. There is no subtlety to exposure therapy. It is an all or nothing exposure to a phobia that teaches a patient to tolerate the distress associated with the exposure. Therapists must be trained to assist the patient through the distress that results from exposure to a phobic stimulus. In contrast, systematic desensitization trains a patient to tolerate progressive exposure to a phobia. In systematic desensitization, the therapist will work with a client to develop an exposure hierarchy, or feared situations ranked from most tolerable to least tolerable. Systematic desensitization teaches a client to stay relaxed when exposed to his or her phobia in increasing amounts over time. The gradual nature of systematic desensitization makes it a different behavioral intervention than exposure therapy. Exposure therapy floods a client with fear until the client learns that the feared outcome is not likely to occur.
While it is important in exposure therapy to expose a client to his or her fear response, care must be taken not to overwhelm the client. The clinician works closely with the client to ensure that the client does not experience overwhelming fear during the process of exposure therapy. This is a critical aspect of the intervention as the conditioned response of fear must be replaced with relaxation. Further, exposure therapy is





most effective when flooding occurs daily until extinction of the response occurs. This might require therapists to assign exposure-based “homework” between weekly sessions.

Exposure therapy was introduced by Joseph Wolpe (1915–1997), a psychiatrist from South Africa, in the 1950s. Wolpe coined the term “reciprocal inhibition” to describe the process of classically conditioning an opposite response to replace an automatic reaction to a stimulus. It was believed that a reaction and its opposite reaction could not exist simultaneously in a patient. Exposure therapy is fundamentally associated with reciprocal inhibition. Reciprocal inhibition creates response prevention, which is the blocking of unwanted avoidance behaviors. Wolpe’s discoveries led to treatments that briefly increase a client’s experience of anxiety but eventually lead to the extinction (removal) of anxiety. During exposure it is necessary for the client to remain as relaxed as possible. Psychotherapeutic techniques of relaxation training paired with exposure are highly effective. A client quickly learns to maintain relaxation in the presence of a feared stimulus. Although exposure therapy was originated by behavior therapists, today this technique is commonly used by cognitive behavioral therapists and even by psychodynamically oriented therapists.
Expressive Arts Therapy
Expressive arts therapy is the practice of using storytelling, imagery, dance, drama, poetry, movement, music, dream work, and visual arts to help promote and encourage personal growth and healing.

Expressive arts therapy is a technique using a multitude of creative mediums to complement and work with the therapeutic process. The notion of expressive arts is not grounded in a specific technique but rather as a response to human suffering. A therapist using expressive arts must be prepared to use a variety of modalities to meet the individual needs of clients. It allows for the human psyche to express itself in an authentic, nonverbal manner through images as opposed to words. These images can be done with motion, sound, action, pictures, and so forth. Many argue that people can express themselves in their truest form by utilizing these creative formats or through creative projections.
   Expressive arts therapy is considered to be a relatively new approach to therapy; however, many believe it connects back to ancient traditions in healing. Each form of expressive arts therapy has its own branch as well as specific training, for example, art therapy, play therapy, and music therapy. Each of these has its own form of training and credentialing. Forms such as art therapy and music therapy have been in formal practice longer and have journals as well as organizations. Many of these have their own ethical guidelines and standards of practice that clinicians must adhere to.
   Expressive arts therapy is sometimes referred to as creative arts in counseling. The art forms include auditory, written, visual, or combinations. Creative arts allows for healing both physically and mentally. In terms of counseling, creativity allows for clients to be more in tune with themselves and encourages them to invest in the process so that they can continue to grow. Using the expressive arts in counseling is considered to be a six-step process. The first step is preparation where background information and data are collected. The second step is incubation where the mind is allowed to wander from the problem at hand. The next step is





ideation whereby ideas are generated using divergent thinking. This is followed by illumination where there is enlightenment. The fifth step is evaluation, which allows for critical and convergent thinking. The final step of verification is where there is a product or action.

Incorporating art into life dates back to ancient times. People would sing, dance, and tell stories all to explore life, find their place, and honor others. Healing practices of indigenous cultures centered around expressive art techniques and rituals. For example, ancient Egyptians encouraged those who were identified as mentally ill to pursue creativity and artistic interests so that in these actions their feelings could be released and they could become whole again. Expressive arts therapy is grounded in humanistic psychotherapy and systems theories.
   The Expressive Therapies Program at Leslie University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was founded in the 1970s by Shaun McNiff, Paolo Knill, Norma Canner, and their colleagues. The emphasis was on having a creative therapeutic community composed of students and faculty. In the 1980s Paolo Knill went on to develop a network of training programs in North America as well as in Europe. These training institutes now exist around the world. Courses exploring the expressive arts are also now a part of many graduate-level counseling programs.
   Over the past 20 years there has been a growth in the field, resulting in separate fields of practice. Clinicians using this modality have to first understand the creative exploration process. Clinicians must understand how to be creative in using these modalities to assist clients. The other side of this is that the term “creativity” is somewhat overused. The key component is divergent thinking, which is thinking in a flexible and exploratory manner. These are associated with coping skills and positive mental health, as well as resiliency and even happiness.
   Creativity or expressive arts in counseling allows for a product to be created that helps provide the client with insight that allows for change within the client. For instance, a client may be given the task of a music autobiography where he or she identifies songs that connect to various important points of his or her life.


At first the client may not realize the connection, but in processing and exploring the songs and their connections, this allows for the client to develop deeper more meaningful insights that allow for growth and healing. Creativity and the expressive arts transcend ethnicities, cultures, races, genders, and age.






Expressive Language Disorder


sensory, or neurological disorders. Even without the presence of these diagnoses, there are some individuals who struggle with expressing themselves using language. These individuals may be diagnosed with expressive language disorder (ELD). Usually people with ELD can understand language while they are not themselves able to communicate clearly in response. In other words, their receptive skills, or ability to understand language, are better than their expressive language. Expressive language is the ability to use language effectively. These individuals demonstrate a normal range of intelligence or IQ as measured by testing.
   Expressive language disorders fall into two categories. ELD can be acquired, which is usually the result of an accident or illness that causes brain damage. This could include temporary or permanent damage caused by something like a stroke. The other type of ELD is developmental, meaning that language acquisition is slower and later than usual. For an accurate diagnosis of ELD the language deficit cannot be the result of a neurological problem. The developmental type is more common in children, and the acquired type occurs more often among adults or the elderly. It is estimated that 10%–15% of children under the age of three are diagnosed with language development delays, including ELD. In more mild cases, the disorder may not be recognized until they go to school where the prevalence of ELD falls off to the 5%–7% range.

In the acquired type of ELD, accidents involving head injury are a common cause of the disorder. But children born into families with a history of language delays are more likely to be diagnosed with the developmental type of ELD. If factors that affect general development, such as malnutrition, exist, a child is more
likely to be diagnosed with ELD.

Expressive language disorder is a deficit in the normal development of language used to communicate with others.

The development of language follows a general pattern when there are no intellectual, developmental,
   
Clinical symptoms of this disorder include limited vocabulary and fewer verbal expressions. Many also make mistakes with verb tense and have difficulty remembering new words. Children with expressive language delays do not talk as much or as often as their peers. Yet they generally understand what is said to them. For example, children with this disorder may be





able to follow two-step commands but may not be able to name their body parts. ELD may manifest itself in difficulties with written language as well.


Expressive language disorder is medically classified as speech sound disorder. ELD may be suspected when there are difficulties with academics or socialization. Medical testing should be conducted to determine whether a diagnosis of ELD is correct. Social withdrawal and co-occurring diagnoses, such as attention-deficit disorder, are commonly associated with ELD.
   Unfortunately, developmental and acquired language disorders do not improve when untreated. Without intervention, the frustration that children and adults with ELD experience may lead to behavior problems. In the case of some children, they may stop attempting to learn as they reach adolescence. When concerned about language development issues, it is best to consult a speech-language pathologist to see if a diagnosis of ELD is appropriate.


Language therapy is the best and most direct means to treat this disorder. The goal of this therapy is to use speech therapy techniques to increase the number of words and phrases a child or adult can use. Ideally a supportive community of parents, teachers, and health-care professionals should be involved in the treatment. In cases where the self-esteem of the individual has been severely affected, some counseling or psychotherapy may also be recommended.





“Introversion” and “extraversion” refer to two components of personality type originally developed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl G. Jung (1875–1961) and are a part of most theories of personality type.

• Dichotomy, or dichotomous, refers to the division of two opposing or contradictory constructs, ideas, or forces in which being high in one is to be low in the other.


“Personality type” refers to a collection of personality traits and preferences that produce a consistent and predictable pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Extraversion and introversion (E/I) are two components of personality type first proposed and developed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung in the 1920s to explain differences in people’s behaviors. Jung believed that differences in behavior were accounted for by how individuals use their minds in different ways. These differences result in reliable patterns of behavior that can be identified in order to better understand individuals. Personality type consists of several identified and labeled patterns of thinking and behaving. There are many theories of personality type, with a variety of different labels depending on the theorist and model of personality theory. Extraversion and introversion are identified patterns that virtually all personality type theories utilize in their research, including the Neo Inventories based on the Big Five factor model and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).
One of the most popular and widely used instruments in understanding normal personality differences is the (MBTI). Building on Jung’s theories Katharine Cook Briggs (1875–1968) and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers (1897–1961) applied Jung’s ideas to understanding psychological type and appreciating differences between people. The MBTI measures preferences based on four dichotomies, each consisting of two opposite poles. E/I represents one of the polar dichotomies where extraversion is on one end with introversion on the other and scoring high on one end corresponds with scoring low on the other. The MBTI does not measure the strength of a preference but rather the clarity of the preference. High or low scores do not mean you are highly extraverted or introverted but rather you have a clear preference for one or the other. The MBTI identifies preferences by asking respondents to choose between two dichotomous statements such as the following: do you prefer to focus on the outer world or on your own inner world?
Myers–Briggs identifies extraverts as people who
focus on the outer world of people and activities; they direct their energy toward, and receive their energy from, interacting with people and activities. Extraverts prefer to communicate by talking, learn best by doing, are sociable and expressive, and take initiative in work and relationships. Extraverts are outgoing, comfortable with people and groups, have a wide range of friends, and can be impulsive. Introverts prefer the inner world of ideas, memories, and thoughts. Introverts are reflective, often seen as “reserved,” comfortable with being alone, have a small group of trusted friends, and can be slow to act.
   Over the past 50 years, personality researchers have identified five dimensions or domains to personality commonly referred to as “The Big Five” or the “Five Factor Model” (FFM) of personality. The Big Five has been extensively researched, with a considerable body of literature supporting the FFM. The investigations of many personality theorists, including Robert McCrae, and Paul Costa, Jr., have led to the development of the NEO Inventories, which use a lexical approach to identifying the dimensions of personality. The lexical approach recognizes that people use natural language to describe experiences. Thousands of trait adjectives (e.g., nervous, accommodating, outgoing, friendly) were scientifically analyzed in numerous


research studies and led to the identification of the five personality traits that exist, in varying dimensions, in all people. The FFM differs from the MBTI in that the MBTI identifies discrete and specific “types,” whereas the FFM describes people in terms of a continuous dimension. For instance, in the MBTI a person is designated as either an extravert or an introvert; in the FFM a person is located somewhere along a path between extraversion and introversion. The FFM recognizes that most people are actually “ambiverts” and display a combination of introverted and extraverted tendencies. The FFM domains of personality are neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.
   The FFM identifies extraverts as sociable, preferring large groups and gatherings. They are assertive, active, and talkative and like excitement and stimulation. They are also upbeat, optimistic, energetic, and cheerful. Introversion is not to be seen as the opposite of extraversion but rather the absence of extraverted preferences. Introverts are reserved but not unfriendly, independent rather than followers, even-paced not sluggish, and prefer to be alone but not because they are shy. Although introverts are not highly spirited, they are not unhappy or pessimistic. The FFM does not relate introspection or reflection to E/I.


Both the MBTI and FMM have made a considerable impact on society but in different ways. The MBTI is an extremely popular personality indicator that has been used in thousands of consumer, education, self-help, and business applications throughout the world. The MBTI has been criticized by researchers as lacking a scientific psychometric instrument and has not been utilized in scientifically rigorous personality research. The FFM and the NEO Inventories are highly regarded by researchers for their scientific and psychometric qualities and are extensively used in a vast array of personality research inquiry.
   The concept of E/I has been widely accepted as a fundamental dimension of personality and embraced by both the scientific community and general population. E/I continues to be extensively researched, and





many scientific articles and popular trade books have been published.




Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is an effective form of psychotherapy that assists people in the alleviation of psychological, emotional, and physiological distress related to traumatic experiences and memories.


• Bilateral eye movement is to look with the eyes to the right and then to the left without moving the head.
• Desensitization means to decrease unwarranted negative emotional response to situations or circumstances by repeated exposure to memories or triggers.
• Reprocessing means to rethink, reorganize, and reconsider the meaning and significance of painful events.


• Triggers are situations that activate memories and emotional states associated with a past traumatic event.


Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing is a type of psychotherapy developed by Francine Shapiro that assists individuals heal from the emotional distress of traumatic experiences. EMDR facilitates the accessing and reprocessing of traumatic and painful memories that are causing psychological distress. EMDR is known for its unique use of eye movement during the treatment phase of psychotherapy. During treatment clients are instructed to move their eyes back and forth while thinking about the traumatic event, present triggers, and anticipated future situations. In addition to eye movement, alternate tapping of left-then-right fingers or hearing auditory tones directed at left-then-right ears can be utilized. This “dual stimulation” of memories/thoughts and physical stimulation aids in desensitizing the client to the traumatic event, thus reducing the unwanted and unwarranted emotional response. Reprocessing focuses on vivid visual images related to the memory, negative beliefs about self, related emotions and body sensations, and developing new positive beliefs. During treatment clients develop new insight and associations regarding the memories, triggers, and beliefs about the traumatic experience.
EMDR consists of eight phases of treatment.
Phase one includes history taking, assessing readiness for EMDR, identifying targets for reprocessing, and the development of a treatment plan. Phase two consists of assessing client coping skills and equipping the client with methods for handling and reducing psychological stress. In phases three through six, targets are identified and processed using EMDR. Phase seven is closure and clients are instructed to journal any related material that may arise. Phase eight examines the progress made.

EMDR was developed by American psychologist Francine Shapiro (1948) who, in 1987, was taking a walk and thinking through some personally





Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing is an effective form of psychotherapy that assists people in the alleviation of psychological, emotional, and physiological distress related to traumatic experiences and memories




distressing memories. She observed that her eyes movements might be related to the decrease in the negative emotions she experienced during the walk. Over the next several years Shapiro further explored the interaction between eye movement, memories, and cognitions resulting in the development of Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) theory. The AIP model theorizes that memory networks contain related images, emotions, sensations, and thoughts related to events that take place in life. Humans have an inherent information processing system that naturally results in adaptation to these events. AIP hypothesizes that information related to traumatic events is not fully processed and the memories are stored as they were experienced at the time of the stressful event. Shapiro proposed that unprocessed stressful experiences cause distress and mental health problems such as anxiety


and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). According to Shapiro EMDR alleviates the distress by processing the experiences and linking them to more adaptive information.
   EMDR has been highly researched as a treatment for PTSD and has been found to be effective in the reduction of PTSD symptoms when compared to no treatment. EMDR has been found to be equivalent in outcomes to more traditional exposure therapy and cognitive behavior therapy. EMDR has been criticized as being a modification of existing exposure therapy, with the eye movements being noncritical to outcomes. Some research suggests that eye movement may not contribute to positive outcomes and other research indicates it does. The exact function of the eye movement component of EMDR is inconclusive and continues to be investigated. EMDR is also being





studied in assessing the effectiveness of the method in treating a variety of mental health disorders such as phobias, anxiety, panic, and depression. EMDR is a complex psychotherapy, which utilizes numerous psychotherapeutic techniques that contribute to its effectiveness in treating trauma-related distress.

Sleepwalking is a condition in which individuals get up and walk around while still sleeping. In DSM-5 it is a diagnosable sleep disorder called a non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep arousal disorder. Sleep-walking is also known as somnambulism.

Definitions
•	Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a device for treating sleep apnea that delivers air into airways through a spe-cially designed face or nasal mask.
 

•	DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statis¬tical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edi¬tion, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
•	Non-REM sleep is one of the two basic states of sleep consisting of stages 1, 2 (light sleep) and 3, 4 (deep sleep). It is also known as non-rapid eye movement and NREM sleep.
•	Obstructive sleep apnea is a type of sleep apnea in which a blockage of the upper airway causes the body to snore and struggle for air.
•	Parasomnia is a group of sleep disorders characterized by abnormal events that occur during sleep, such as sleepwalking, talking, or limb movement.
•	REM sleep is a stage in the normal sleep cycle characterized by rapid eye movement, dreaming, loss of reflexes, and increased brain activity. It is also known as rapid eye movement and REM sleep.
•	Restless leg syndrome is a sleep disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move one’s legs while attempting to rest.
•	Sleep disorders are a group of mental dis¬orders characterized by disturbance in the amount and quality of sleep and that cause significant emotional distress or interfere with daily functioning.

Description and Diagnosis
Sleepwalking is a condition and diagnosable sleep dis¬order where individuals get up and walk around while still asleep. These episodes occur while these indi¬viduals are in the deep stages of sleep. Usually, their eyes are open with a glassy, staring appearance as they walk. They may talk incoherently while walking, and on questioning, their responses are slow or absent. If they are returned to bed without awakening, they sel¬dom remember the event.
This is classified as a parasomnia, which is a class of sleep disorders that occur during arousals from REM
 


 

sleep or partial arousals from non-REM sleep. They include nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, and restless leg syndrome in addition to sleepwalking disorder. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, sleepwalking is listed as a nonrapid eye movement sleep arousal disorder. Individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit recurrent episodes of getting out of bed during sleep and walking around. During the episodes they stare blankly, are unresponsive when others attempt to communicate with them, and are only awakened with great difficulty. The episodes must cause significant distress to the individual or result in significant level of impaired functioning. In addition, the dis¬order is not the result of a substance, medication, other medical condition, or another mental disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Various factors can cause this disorder. These can include genetic and environmental factors. Since sleepwalking runs in families, it may have a genetic basis. If one or both parents have a history of the disorder, it increases the likelihood of a child experiencing the disorder. Sleepwalking may occur when another medical condition that can affect sleep is present. These are ob¬structive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, migraines, or head injuries. In addition, alcohol, recreational drugs, and certain medications (antihistamines, sedatives, and sleep medications) can trigger sleepwalking.



Treatment for sleepwalking may not be needed. A sleep¬walker can often be gently lead back to bed. While it may not be dangerous to awaken the sleepwalker, it can be disorienting to them. If sleepwalking is caused by a med¬ical or mental health condition, treatment is directed to that condition. For instance, if the sleepwalking is due to obstructive sleep apnea, the use of a continuous positive airway pressure device may be recommended. Should sleepwalking result in excessive daytime sleepiness, medication may be prescribed. Medications like Xanax or Prozac might be used with a continuous positive airway pressure device to stop episodes of sleepwalking.
 



Smoking cessation is the process associated with discontinuing a nicotine-smoking habit.

•	Nicotine replacement therapy is a type of treatment used to aid in smoking cessation that substitutes medications such as transder¬mal nicotine patches, lozenges, gum, inhalers, and other prescribed pharmaceuticals to help alleviate cravings, anxiety, and withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting.

Description
Smoking cessation describes the process one undergoes when trying to quit tobacco smoking. Tobacco contains an addictive carcinogen called nicotine that is a significant contributor in a multitude of health-related issues, including cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. Various interventions have been employed to assist those in quitting smoking, including nicotine replacement therapy, individual and small group counseling, and acu¬puncture. Many smokers though are reluctant to quit due to short-term side effects such as weight gain, headaches, stomachaches, and other withdrawal-related symptoms, including anxiety and irritability. However, research indicates that the benefits of discontinuing a nicotine habit greatly outweigh the costs. Studies have also found that it takes anywhere from 6 to 12 weeks
 


 

after one has quit smoking completely for the nicotine levels in the brain to return to levels of a nonsmoker. Health damage, though not entirely reversible, can be reduced if one quits smoking.
Cigarettes contain the chemical nicotine, which users can become addicted to. Nicotine acts on nicotine acetylcholine receptors in the brain causing them to release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid which causes cravings and withdrawal symptoms when ceased. Nicotine addiction is the most common form of addiction reported in the United States. Smokers generally increase the amount of cigarettes that they smoke per day over time, drastically increasing their risk of long-term health damage. The primary health concern for prolonged use is the development of certain types of cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women, with approximately 90% of cases in men and 80% of cases in women being attributed to smoking. Nicotine use can also contribute to incidents of stroke, heart problems, and infertility.
Interventions to address nicotine addiction include both unassisted and assisted forms of treatment. Unassisted types refer to situations where users attempt to quit on their own volition, without the help of a health professional or the use of pharmaceuticals. Patients who attempt to quit “cold turkey” by eliminating all use or those who reduce their consumption on their own gradually over time would be classified as unassisted. The success rate for these individuals though is quite low, between 4% and 8%. Assisted types, on the other hand, include a range of treatments focused on emotional and psychological support and supple¬mental medication when necessary. Data further sug¬gests that medical and dental providers who discuss health-care risks and encourage cessation readily with their patients are more likely to gain cooperation and yield higher success rates. Other beneficial forms of assisted treatment include nicotine replacement therapy, which makes use of medications, counseling, biofeedback, and even acupuncture. The American Cancer Society has projected a six-month success rate of around 30% for smokers who used other forms of assistance, referred to as nicotine replacement therapy, when trying to quit. Examples include transdermal nicotine patches, lozenges, gum, inhalers, and electronic
 

cigarettes. Prescribed medications such as Bupropion, Varenicline, Moclobemide, Nortriptyline, and Clonidine, some of which are antidepressants, have also proven useful. Most smokers will attempt to quit several times throughout their lives, but most are unsuccessful, returning to the habit within six months.


Cigarette smoking results in nearly 450,000 deaths each year, with approximately 49,000 of these due to exposure to second-hand smoke. Several forms of cancer, emphysema, coronary heart disease, stroke, and infertility have all been linked to smoking. Lawsuits have also been brought against Big Tobacco companies for their past failure in accurately informing and warning the public as to the dangers of cigarette smoking. Smoking cessation is a difficult process for many people and may require the assistance of healthcare professionals or the use of medications. In the United States alone, it is estimated that some 60% of current smokers report that they would like to quit smoking. Studies are ongoing to determine not only the long-term health risks but also best forms of treatment for smoking addiction. Recent interventions have made use of web-based support groups and computer programs to assist addicts hoping to quit. Research indicates, however, that certain combinations of medications and nicotine replacement therapies have the highest rates of continued success. These include: (1) long-term nicotine patch and NRT gum/spray, (2) nicotine patch and nicotine inhaler, and (3) nicotine patch and Bupropion. A 2008 meta-analysis conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence also revealed that cigarette smokers were more likely to quit when they were informed about the risks and felt supported by their health-care provider, noting the importance of a positive relationship between doctor and patient.
 


 




Sobriety is the condition of complete abstinence from all mind-altering substances as well as increased mental, physical, and spiritual health.

Definitions
•	Abstinence is the choice not to engage in certain behaviors or give in to desires such as alcohol or drug use.
 

•	Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain, which involves compulsive and uncontrolled pursuit of reward or relief with substance use or other compulsive behaviors.
•	Alcoholics Anonymous is a mutual aid or self-help fellowship that was founded in 1935 to help individuals struggling with alcoholism.
•	Mind-altering substances are drugs or alcohol that can significantly influence perceptions, thoughts, and behaviors.
•	Recovery is a series of steps individuals takes to improve their wellness and health, while living a self-directed (responsible) life and striving to reach their highest potential.
•	Twelve-Step Programs are self-help groups whose members attempt recovery from various addictions based on a plan called the Twelve Steps.


Sobriety requires the complete abstinence from any mind-altering substances. It also involves an increased level of health and balance in life. In this sense, sobriety involves a transformation in an individual’s mental, physical, and spiritual health. An individual who has abstained from mind-altering substances but desires to resume use or engages in behavior patterns when he or she was using is not considered to be sober. In other words, sobriety requires much more than abstinence. Sobriety also includes repairing (making amends) to old relationships, as well as building new ones. Accordingly, sobriety is part of the process of recovery.
Overcoming addiction requires a huge commitment, and discovering how to get sober is the first step. Since sobriety can take a lot of time and effort, it may be helpful for addicts to find reasons to stop using and state these reasons with clarity. Some of the reasons may include an addict rebuilding damaged relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. Many individuals who suffer addiction may also have jeopardized their professional life and have legal issues to face. Whether an individual has been addicted to a substance for a short or long period, achieving
 


 

sobriety is possible when an addict takes the following steps. These steps include a commitment to stop using all mind-altering substances, setting short-term and long-term goals, and developing a treatment plan. Finding a support network (e.g., Alcoholics Anony¬mous) and planning to live a life free of mind-altering substances are also important steps in sobriety.

The first step of sobriety is complete abstinence from mind-altering substances. Participating in psychotherapy and Twelve-Step Programs has been shown to be effective forms of treatment for individuals seeking so¬briety. In many cases individuals cannot get sober by attending Twelve-Step Programs and psychotherapy alone. An individual may need additional help, such as participating in an inpatient or outpatient treatment program. Once an individual completes an inpatient or outpatient treatment program, becoming involved in a Twelve-Step Program and participating in psychotherapy is generally the best form of treatment for individuals achieving sobriety.


Social anxiety disorder is a mental disorder characterized by excessive and unreasonable fear of being judged or evaluated by others. Previously it was referred to as social phobia.
 

•	Antianxiety medications are prescribed drugs that relieve anxiety symptoms. They are also called anxiolytics or tranquilizers.
•	Anxiety is a negative emotional state characterized by feelings of nervousness, worry, and apprehension about an imagined danger.
•	Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by anxiety, which tends to be intermittent instead of persistent. The group includes panic disorder, phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder.
•	Behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing mal-adaptive behaviors.
•	Cognitive therapy is a type of cognitive behavior therapy that focuses on identifying and changing automatic thoughts and mal¬adaptive beliefs.
•	Exposure therapy is a behavior therapy intervention (method) in which a client is exposed to a feared object or situation.
•	Fear is an emotional response to a known danger.
•	Phobia is an intense fear of a person, place, or thing that significantly exceeds the actual danger posed.

Social anxiety disorder is one of the group of DSM-5 anxiety disorders in which an individual experiences distressing anxiety in social situations or in anticipa¬tion of social situations. More specifically, those with this disorder experience anxiety regarding the scrutiny of others that is abnormally severe. Often, their anxiety revolves around some sort of performance such as a presentation, dance, or speech. In more severe cases, simply attending a party or having a conversation with a stranger may be sufficient to induce significant anxiety. Social anxiety disorder can cause someone to become isolated or in severe cases unable to maintain relationships and/or become unemployed.
 


 

It is not uncommon for them to experience anxiety or fear regarding certain social circumstance. What characterizes this disorder from normal social functioning is that the anxiety almost always occurs as opposed to occasionally. The prevalence of this disorder in the United States is relatively common, affecting approximately 7% of the population. However, this disorder seems to occur far more frequently in the United States than it does in other countries. It is reported that it affects approximately 2% of European countries and less than 2% in the remainder of the world population. This disorder tends to affect roughly equal numbers of males and females. Also, it usually manifests during adolescence (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals must experience anxiety regarding social situations that is primarily focused on the critical scrutiny of others. They must fear that their own behavior will in some way be perceived as embarrassing. Also, they must experience anxiety in regard to almost all social situations. They must also actively avoid these situations as a direct consequence of their anxiety or experience intense anxiety while in the social situation. In addition, the anxiety experienced must be significantly disproportionate to the actual consequence posed by the situation. Also, the conditions and symptoms mentioned earlier must have been present for at least six months.
The exact cause of this disorder is unknown, but it is thought to result from the interaction of a number of factors. Like other anxiety disorders, it is believed that genetics, brain structure, and an individual’s environment are factors. A family history of anxiety, depression, or neuroticism may predispose individuals to social anxiety disorder. Also, an overactive or sensitive amygdala, one of the brain structures involved in fear, may also influence the manifestation or expe¬rience of social anxiety. In addition, an individual’s unique experience, especially adverse social experiences in childhood, may be a risk factor in the development of this disorder.


This disorder is commonly treated with exposure therapy or cognitive therapy but may also be treated with
 

medication. In exposure therapy of this disorder, individuals are slowly exposed to the specific social situation that causes them anxiety. The aim of exposure is to break the conditioned cycle of response. At first, the individual may be asked to perform a relaxation technique such rhythmic breathing. Once individuals have reached the relaxed state, they might be asked to imagine themselves entering a social situation that usually causes them a great deal of anxiety, but instead of avoiding the situation, they imagine themselves acting differently. Such exercises become progressively closer to the actual experience of the original social circumstances that were the focus of the individual anxiety. Eventually, such activities result in the extinction of the behaviors that were once associated with social anxiety.
Cognitive therapy is also used, often in conjunction with exposure therapy. The aim of this therapy is to help the individual uncover and understand his or her faulty beliefs about criticism of others and social situations. Self-help workbooks that incorporate both behavioral and cognitive techniques may also be used. In addition to these therapy techniques, medications are also employed in the treatment of this disorder. Both antidepressant medication and antianxiety medication may be utilized but serve different purposes. Antidepressants such as Prozac and Zoloft are used to reduce the severity and frequency of experienced anxiety, but do little to reduce acute symptoms once they manifest. This is in contrast to antianxiety medications such as Ativan or Klonopin, which are used to reduce acute symptoms.
 


 



Social anxiety disorder (SAD) in youth is a marked and persistent fear of social situations in which a person may feel shame or extreme psychological discomfort.

Social anxiety disorder in children is one diagnosis within the category of anxiety disorders. The disorder is usually diagnosed in the period of a person’s life be¬tween late childhood and young adulthood. Individuals who experience SAD are scared of performing in social situations. They often experience physical symptoms of discomfort when socializing with others. SAD is also known as social phobia. Social anxiety disorder is one of the most common of all anxiety disorders. Approximately 12% of the U.S. population is diagnosed with some kind of SAD (American Psychiatric
 

Association, 2013). That rate of occurrence makes it the third most prevalent psychiatric disorder after depression and alcoholism.
SAD is characterized by intense internally generated fear in social situations. This fear causes considerable distress and can result in an impaired ability to interact with others in daily life. Often this can occur without any obvious signs or symptoms of anxiety. Individuals with SAD often think that others in social situations are passing unfavorable judgment on them. This makes the individual with SAD extremely self-conscious and fearful of being embarrassed by his or her own actions. These fears can be triggered by the misperception or the actual reality that the individual is being judged by other people.


As is true with many other mental health conditions, SAD probably arises from a complex interaction of ge¬netics and environment. Some researchers have identi¬fied possible causes, which include a combination of genetically inherited traits that affect brain chemistry or structural problems with the amygdala that cause it to be overactive. Anxiety disorders in general often recur across generations of families. But it is not clear whether it is genetics alone, or the familial patterns of learned behaviors, or a combination of these things that influences this behavior more strongly.
Social anxiety disorder tends to develop early in life. About half of individuals who have this disorder have developed it by the age of 11 and almost all have developed it by age 20. It is understandable that children who are the victims of teasing, bullying, rejection, and humiliation are more likely to suffer from SAD. In addition to that, other negative events in life such as family conflict, death in the family, or abuse may be associated with SAD. Social anxiety disorder often occurs in combination with issues of low self-esteem and depression.
There are many physical symptoms that often accompany SAD. Some include excessive blushing of the face, sweating (hyperhidrosis), trembling, palpitations, and nausea. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. Verbal stammering may also be present for those with social anxiety.
 
In order to be diagnosed with SAD an individual must demonstrate several behavioral characteristics. These include persistent fear of one or more social situations, which may bind them to specific people and places. The person must recognize that his or her fear is excessive and that it negatively influences normal routines or daily activities. Lastly, in order to receive the diagnosis, the phobia cannot be caused by a substance or other medical condition.
An early diagnosis may allow those who are diagnosed with SAD to get both psychological and medication help. Both talk therapy and medication can minimize the symptoms of anxiety and the development of any other issues such as depression. Some people who suffer from SAD may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce their fears and inhibitions during social events. It is common for those who experience social phobias to self-medicate with alcohol or other drugs, especially when they are undiagnosed and untreated. While the fear of social interaction may be recognized by the person himself or herself and considered unreasonable, it can be difficult to overcome.

A person with the disorder may be treated with psy-chotherapy, medication, or both. Psychotherapy or counseling can help people with SAD to recognize and change negative thoughts about themselves. Cognitive behavior therapy is the approach most favored for those with anxiety. This therapy helps deal with the role that your own thoughts, especially those about yourself, play in leading to your actions and behaviors. Group therapy, skills training, relaxation, and role-playing are also effective approaches for controlling stress in social situations.
If drugs are required, the patient will usually start with a low dose in order to reduce the risk of side effects. Remember in all cases, whether it is psychotherapy or drugs, that treatment is not a cure. Treatment can be brief or take some time for the symptoms to change and diminish. It is important to be patient when dealing with and treating anxiety disorders.
 


Social communication disorder is a mental disorder characterized by difficulties with the social language and communication skills.


•	Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a problem with the inability to focus and con-centrate, being overactive, and the inability to control behavior.
•	Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevel-opmental disorder that impairs an individual’s ability to interact and communicate with others. It also includes repetitive interests, behaviors, and activities, and causes significant impairment in occupational, social, or other important areas of functioning.
•	Developmental disabilities is a diverse group of serious chronic conditions due to mental and/or physical impairments. They may cause an individual difficulty with language, mobility, learning, and independent living.
•	DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
 


 

•	Global developmental delay is a significant delay in two or more developmental areas of an individual.
•	Intellectual disabilities are characterized by significant limitations in both adaptive behavior and intellectual functioning.
•	Language impairment is a disorder in one or more of the basic learning processes involved in understanding or in using spoken or written language.
•	Learning disabilities are neurological disorders that make it difficult for an individual to acquire certain academic and social skills. They affect the brain’s ability to receive, process, store, respond to, and communicate information.
•	Linguistics is the scientific study of language, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
•	Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of DSM-5 disorders characterized by impairments of brain function that affect language, learning ability, self-control, and memory that develop as an individual grows. They include intellectual developmental disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and social communication disorder.
•	Speech therapy is treatment of speech and communication disorders, which is usually performed by a speech-language therapist.


Social communication disorder is one of the DSM-5 neurodevelopmental disorders. It is characterized by impairment in how meaning is created and understood, and delayed language development. Symptoms include limited variety in the use of language, and difficulty understanding the main point of a question, understanding what is socially appropriate. It may be a specific diagnosis or may occur within the circum¬stances of other conditions, such as specific language impairment, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disabilities,  learning  disabilities,  attention-deficit
 

hyperactivity disorder, developmental disabilities, and serious brain injuries. Emotional and psychological disorders and loss of hearing may also affect social communication skills. A child or teenager with this disorder will have problems in following normal social rules of communication whether nonverbal or verbal. These individuals often have difficulty following the rules for conversations, that is, taking turns in a conversation. Changing language depending on the situation and needs of the listener is another difficulty for these individuals. These social communication difficulties result in problems participating in a social manner with others, communicating effectively with others, and performing academically. This disorder is most commonly diagnosed by the age of five, since most children possess adequate speech and language abilities (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However, there are milder forms of this disorder that may not become recognizable until early adolescence. This is the period of when language and social interac¬tions become more complex.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they have persistent difficulties in the social use of nonverbal and verbal communication. This is demonstrated by deficits in communication for social purposes (e.g., sharing information with another individual that is appropriate for the social context). The individual must have impaired ability to change communication to match the situation of the listener (e.g., speaking differently in a classroom than when playing with friends). Individuals must have difficulties with following rules during storytelling and conversations. Individuals may have problems rephrasing a statement when misunderstood, and difficulty knowing how to use verbal and nonverbal gestures to manage interactions with others. These individuals must also have difficulties grasping what is not explicitly stated. These deficits must result in functional limitations in social participation, effective communication, academic achievement, social relationships, or occupational performance. These deficits may occur individually or in combination with each other. The onset of symptoms of this disorder occurs in the early developmental period, and the symptoms are not a result of another medical or neurological
 


 

condition. The symptoms must not be derived from low abilities in the area of grammar and word structure, and are not better explained by global developmental delay, an intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, or another medical disorder.
The exact causes of social communication disorder are unknown. A family history of communication disorders, autism spectrum disorder, or a specific learning disorder appears to increase the risk for social communication disorder (American Psychiatric Asso¬ciation, 2013).

Treatment for social communication disorder is tailored to the individual’s need. Speech therapy is one form of treatment in which the goal is to help the individual recognize and correctly interpret verbal and nonverbal cues and expressions. It also assists individuals in differentiating between a sincere voice and a sarcastic one, or between an angry or mean voice. Speech therapists also help individuals to use verb tenses correctly and distinguish between singular and plural nouns. Role-playing is also used to assist individuals to practice taking turns in a conversation. The speech-language therapist will confront and assist the individual with social communication disorder when the individual is speaking far too long. The therapist can also work with the child’s parents and teachers and help coach them on ways to improve the child’s communication skills. The prognosis for this disorder depends on support of the family, the child’s intelligence level, and whether he or she has any other medical or mental disorder.

 



Social justice counseling (SJC) is a multifaceted ap¬proach to therapy that incorporates collaborative social advocacy and activism to promote growth and development of individuals, families, and communities.

Definitions
•	Activism refers to the actions and behaviors taken to promote social or political change.
•	Advocacy is the act of supporting, recommending, asking, or pleading for a particular cause, policy, or need of a group or individual.
•	Social Inequality refers to the existence of unequal opportunities or distribution of resources because of social position or status with a social group.
•	Systemic abuse refers to the existences and maintenance of social inequalities due to a larger system such as the laws, policies, and practices of the land.


Social Justice counseling is based in the belief that all people have a right to equitable treatment and access to services and resources. SJC focuses on issues of oppression, privilege, and social inequities of individuals and group that have been systematically excluded on the basis of race, ethnicity, age, gender, education, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, physical or mental disability, and other aspects of group membership. SJC incorporates social advocacy and activ¬ism as a means to address inequitable social, political,
 


 

and economic conditions that impede academic, career, personal, and social development of individuals, families, groups, and communities. Social justice counselors operate from the belief that client problems must take into account the oppressive social and envi¬ronmental barriers that impede development, growth, change, and harmony.
SJC requires mental health professionals to expand how they conceptualize client problems to include the impact of oppression and inequality on client outcomes. Social justice counselors empower and join clients in the active confrontation of injustice and inequality. The goal of SJC is to ensure that every individual has the opportunity to reach his or her potential free from oppression and other unnecessary external barriers to a quality education, healthcare services, and employment opportunities. The process for achieving social justice is through a collaborative therapeutic experience in which clients become aware and knowledgeable of all external barriers that debilitate their development. Clients participate in skill building to address, change, and overcome those barriers.
SJC requires counselors to include advocacy as a core helping competency. Recognizing the critical role counselors play in assisting clients overcome oppression, the American Counseling Association (ACA) adopted an advocacy competencies model. This model identifies the extent of involvement of the client in the advocacy process and the level of intervention on an individual, systemic, or societal level. Counselors may choose to advocate with the client or on behalf of the client.
At an individual level social justice counselors work with clients to empower them. Empowerment includes facilitating the process of identifying, naming, and developing strategies to overcome oppressive barriers. This may also include assisting clients develop self-advocacy skills and locate resources that can help address social, political, economic, and systemic change.
At a systems level, counselors engage in community collaboration in which they work with a larger group to address an oppression or barrier impacting the community. This is similar to individual empowerment but at a group level. Systems advocacy is used by counselors on behalf of a group or community in
 

which the group may not be aware that a systemic barrier exists may fear repercussions from the larger system or may not have the power, credibility, or voice to address the issue.
For example, during consultation two counselors at a university become aware that a particular college department has behaved in a discriminatory fashion toward a particular ethnic group. The individual client/students were unaware of the pattern or that other students had attempted to address it without results and that others had left the college because of it. Recog¬nizing that an oppressive barrier exists, the counselors could empower the students on an individual level by assisting them in recognizing and naming the inequality, organize and unite them at the community collaboration level, and engage in systems advocacy by informing the department of the problem and organizing a safe process of resolution.
Other social justice advocacy competencies include counselors engaging in public information to raise awareness about an issue. Social or political advocacy occurs when counselors work directly with policy makers and legislators to address issues impacting client groups.

SJC has its roots in the multicultural counseling movement developed in the 1990s. A multicultural perspective led to a deeper understanding of cultural variables and the need to view client problems in the context of the external environment, including sociopolitical factors that impact client functioning. The growth of SJC can be attributed to the growing diversity of the American population and the recognition by counselors that not all personal problems can be solved in a counseling office with an individual client. In 2003, the ACA, drawing from the multicultural literature, adopted the advocacy competencies and by the mid-2000s counseling from a social justice perspective was emerging as another force in the field. SJC continues to be further developed and is included in many graduate counseling programs.
 


 





Social learning theory is a way to understand how people behave and interact with others based on social contexts.


Social learning theory was started and developed by psychologist Albert Bandura (1925). The development of this theory moved beyond traditional behavioral theory. Instead the focus of social learning theory is to anchor the human learning process and new behaviors to human observation of other people’s actions. Bandura, who is an emeritus professor at Stanford University, is recognized as one of the four great psychologists of the 20th century; he is included along¬side Sigmund Freud, B. F. Skinner, and Jean Piaget.
Bandura showed that the social context of learning was key to thinking and behavior. This concept is most notably demonstrated in his Bobo doll experiments first conducted in 1961. The Bobo doll experiments used a five foot tall blow-up doll named Bobo. Bobo was weighted on the bottom so that when it was knocked over it would spring up again. Bandura set up experiments with nursery school children, aged three to six. He had half the children observe adults interacting aggressively with the Bobo doll. This included hitting it, knocking it over, and kicking it. The other half of the group were with an adult who simply played with other toys while ignoring the Bobo doll. Bandura exposed the children to these activities, one by one, so as to eliminate group pressure. There was also a control group who saw no modeling of behavior at all.
 

What Bandura discovered was that children who witnessed aggressive behaviors tended to demonstrate those same behaviors. This occurred more so than with the children who had not seen aggressive behavior. He also noted that boys who had seen an adult male act aggressive tended to be more aggressive themselves than boys who had seen the same behavior from an adult female. Although same sex behavior modeling seemed to be more influential in terms of outcomes, girls in general tended to be almost 50% less aggres¬sive than boys.
The Bobo doll experiments were criticized on many levels. Bandura conducted a revised version of the experiments in 1963. When adding a reward or punishment for the adult aggressive behaviors, things changed. He found that incorporating such conse¬quences did impact whether or not the children them¬selves acted aggressively.
The main theme of social learning theory is that people learn by watching other people. This is true not only in terms of their motor behaviors, like hitting or kicking, but also in the way they may use language. But it seems clear that humans are not automatic copy-cats of behavior. Just because something has been observed or learned does not mean that behavior will change. As Bandura (1971) once wrote, “In the social learning view, man is neither driven by inner forces nor buffeted helplessly by environmental influences. Rather, psychological functioning is best understood in terms of a continuous reciprocal interaction between behavior and its controlling conditions.”

Social learning theory moved beyond pure behavioral theories and practice, to see learning as part of a social process. It shows that learning can take place from observing behavior or the consequences of behavior. But learning is not passive observation; it requires gathering information and decision making. And while it is true that reinforcement plays a role in learning, it is not the only component necessary for learning. Social learning theory concludes that thinking, behavior, and environment all play an interactive role in the learning process.
 


 

Bandura’s ideas have become a standard part of understanding human thinking and behavior. His theories helped people understand how anxiety could develop without having direct interactions with a triggering object itself. His work demonstrated that people can also learn from hearing about the experiences of other people.
The current empirical investigations of social learning strategies include a range of research from laboratory studies to observations in the natural environment. These studies consider factors big and small, from individual decision-making processes to obser¬vational work that seeks to explain population-level cultural and social issues. Such empirical studies build off the insight of social learning theory and the complexity of the human learning process.


“Social media” refers to different forms of electronic communication, such as websites, blogs, and chat rooms, that people use to interact with one another to share information, exchange ideas, and establish online communities.

Definition
•	User-generated content defines various types of media content generated by and accessible for use by the general public some examples are videos, blogs, podcasts, social
 

networking sites, wikis, and forums. Since 2005, user-generated content has had various applications, including circulating news and gossip, generating research and problem solving, and gauging public interest and opinion.

Social media applications offer ways for people to interact with one another in the online environment. There are six different types of social media: collaborative projects, blogs and microblogs, content communities, social networking sites, virtual gaming sites, and virtual social worlds. Some social media may com¬bine two or more of these types. The content that is created in these virtual communities is referred to as “user-generated content.” A difference between social media and traditional forms of media is that social media is much more far-reaching, accessible, and permanent. Social media users are able to network, collaborate, share ideas, and socialize right from the comfort of their own computer, cell phone, or tablet. The development of social media has substantially impacted how people communicate with one another in today’s world.
One of the first social media sites was created in 1994, known as Geocities. Social media became widely used in the early 2000s. Since then, social media sites have continued to explode. Nowadays, people use social media sites for a range of functions such as to gather information, post their opinions, catch up with friends, search career opportunities, and even seek out romantic relationships. The business world has benefited and uses social media to conduct market research, promote products and discounts, and foster brand loyalty.
Users cite the quality, immediacy, and accessibility that social media provides as some of the top benefits. The increase in this type of communication has resulted in unlimited access to information provided on the Internet. Many sites are open platforms and do not require registration or membership fees. People are able to connect and form relationships, both personal and professional, with individuals around the world. Answers are only a keystroke or mouse click away.
There are some drawbacks to social media as well. Experts argue that the increase in social media usage
 





 
has drastically decreased the amount of face-to-face interactions that people engage in. Some even suggest that social media usage can be addictive. Many debate further that communicating via social media reduces the quality and personal nature of interactions. Furthermore, users who are not able to establish bound¬aries between their personal and professional selves may be subject to risk. Another limitation, given the ease of use, is the concern over exposure, particularly for minors. Without even trying, one can be subject to graphic images, videos, and even sexual predators. Monitoring minors’ use of social media and setting up parental controls and privacy settings is recommended. Research has also cited a positive correlation between
 
the use of social networking sites and cyber-bullying. In addition, one must question the reliability and validity of the information one finds on the Internet. Ownership and copyright issues are also an issue with social media content.

These types of sites are extremely popular and are accessed by Internet users more than any other type of site. By July 2012, the total time spent on social media in the United States increased 37% to 121 billion minutes from 88 billion minutes just the year before. Facebook is an example of a popular social networking
 


 

site. With over 1 billion active users, it is the primary method for communication among college students in the United States. In addition, 93% of businesses employ Facebook as a marketing tool. Users aged 65 and older are also on the rise; one out of every four people in that demographic is a member of a social networking site.


Social skills training (SST) is a form of therapy used by teachers, therapists, and mental health professionals to help people with social challenges.

•	Social means related to human society or its ways of being organized.


Social skills training (SST) is a widely used treatment for different groups of people who struggle with interacting with others socially. Individual SST is effective when a trained therapist helps one child improve specific social behaviors. Examples of these include use of eye contact and taking turns during play. SST also includes group treatment, which has been effective
 

because of the opportunity to practice with peers and learning from one another. Group SST has been overall proven more effective for clients and efficient for therapists and healthcare systems.
The primary purpose of SST is to teach people how to overcome the problems they experience socially. In SST clients can be taught the interpersonal skills of how to start a conversation or have small talk, how to handle humor in groups, and what to do during a phone call. In most cases people who have trouble socially have not learned how to use and understand social cues. Social cues include verbal and nonverbal behavior. These cues let people know when someone else is bored or when to suggest changing an activity. SST helps teach specific social cues and rules for interaction based on social norms. These social norms can be complicated and require breaking down large concepts into smaller steps. If SST is effective, the people benefiting gain insight and successful experiences from socializing. This in turn positively affects their self-esteem and relationships overall.
There are various techniques and methods that are included in SST. These include teaching, modeling, rehearsal, and homework. People with social challenges often need to learn the rules or norms for socializing, which can be introduced and taught. Utilizing the method of Socratic questioning is a good way of engaging teens and adults in the learning pro¬cess. After being taught it is important to provide a demonstration or real-life example of the skill. This can be done through live modeling or role-playing or through video. After learning and modeling are complete, a chance to practice or rehearse the skills and get feedback is important. During behavioral rehearsals, coaching from clinicians is critical for the delivery of corrective and positive feedback. Finally, having the opportunity to generalize the skills used in treatment outside of therapy is the last step to truly effective SST. Understanding the effective methods of SST allows clinicians to provide a high standard of care with guidelines to help this population learn and grow therapeutically. It allows therapists to teach clients how to have friendships, manage emotions, become independent, and overall have a better quality of life. SST is an effective treatment for individuals with diagnosis
such as autism, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders.
 

In the United States in the 1920s there was a major movement in the school system toward character ed¬ucation. During this movement, the introduction of teaching interpersonal and social skills happened in schools. A few decades later, psychologists became involved in SST through behavior therapy in children. During the 1950s medication treatment for psychotic disorders became popular and psychologists were tasked with helping clients manage their bizarre behaviors. They were required to teach these patients how to interact successfully with others in the community. This is how SST became standard practice in treating individuals with chronic and acute social
issues.


In recent years the demand for SST has increased. Although SST has become popular, few of these have been formally researched and reviewed. Those that have been proven effective focus on changes in behavior and physiology. The advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements have allowed SST to be measured for changes in the brain after treatment. It is likely that the future direction of SST will continue to utilize physiological tests to identify effective social skills treatment.
SST can be used with other treatment to effective treat specific disorders. With disorders such as sub¬stance use or dependence, SST has been used with medication management and coping skills training. It is also commonly used alongside exposure therapy and behavior therapy to treat anxiety disorders. The incorporation of family education and therapy into SST has been extremely successful. Family education and therapy that works directly with the concepts being addressed in SST has the most effective, long-term outcomes. Current research suggests that if family treatment isn’t involved, then follow-up support to SST is helpful.
There are many benefits of SST programs. One is that the treatment can be brief and structured, which allows clients to get maximum potential. Usually clients are placed in a group setting where they get support and resources from those whom they interact with.
 

SST also focuses on new skills that are learned and built upon versus focusing on the history of struggles a client has experienced. This places a positive and concrete focus onto a psychological issue that can be more helpful to clients than analyzing its origins. More research needs to be done on SST, and SST is emerging as a standard best practice in treating those with social problems.


Social workers are professional individuals who work in human service settings assisting individuals, families, and communities.

Social workers are highly trained individuals who most often work in human service settings to help people cope with challenges in their lives. The social work profession has a long and rich history of advocating and assisting underserved and minority populations. Social work core values include respect for the equality, worth, and dignity of human beings civil rights and social justice.
Social workers are represented by the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), the largest membership organization of social workers in
 



the world, representing over 140,000 members, in 56 states and local chapters. According to the NASW the social work mission is to “enhance the effective functioning and well-being of individuals, families, and communities through its work and through its advocacy” (NASW, 2013).
The profession of social work includes three levels of professional qualifications with distinct levels of service provision depending on education. Social workers may have a bachelor’s degree in social work (BSW) or a master’s degree in social work (MSW). Licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs) have an MSW and are licensed in the state where they work to provide mental health services. For those wishing to work in universities or colleges as social work educators, they must earn either a doctorate in social work or a PhD in social work. Over 650,000 individuals hold degrees in social work.
Social workers, those with either a BSW or an MSW degree who are not licensed, provide services in a wide range of social service settings. Service settings include family service agencies, childcare services, adoption and foster care settings, hospitals and community clinics, community mental health programs, disability support agencies, nursing homes and elder care, public health settings, criminal justice and correctional settings, community organizations, homeless organizations, programs for veterans, substance abuse treatment settings, and youth outreach programs. Master-level social workers also provide administrative leadership in social service settings.
Social workers are trained to assist individuals, families, and community organizations. On an individual/family level, social workers provide assessments of needs, identify beneficial resources such as community aid services and programs, develop plans to utilize resources, and provide assistance to individuals and families in need. On a community level social workers work with community and government service agencies in the development and provision of programs and policies to enhance individual and family well-being. Licensed clinical social workers must have a master’s degree in social work and hold state licensure to treat mental health disorders. Attaining state licensure is demanding and requires supervised clinical practice as a social work intern for a minimum of two years
 

after graduating with an MSW. Although states vary somewhat in their requirements, licensure generally requires 1,500 hours of face-to-face psychotherapy experience while receiving clinical supervision from a state-qualified supervisor. LCSWs are qualified to diagnose and treat mental, behavioral, and emotional disorders such as depression, anxiety, trauma, and other mental disorders and conditions. They provide psychotherapeutic services to individuals, groups, couples, and families. LCSWs may also work in private practice, providing psychotherapeutic services for a fee.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor lists the following occu¬pations as having job duties similar to social workers: health educators, mental health counselors, marriage and family therapists; probation officers and correc¬tional treatment specialists; psychologists; rehabilita¬tion counselors; school and career counselors; social and human service assistants, and substance abuse and behavioral disorder counselors. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor as of 2010 the median annual wage of all social workers was $42,480, with half the work¬ers earning more and half the workers earning less. The top 10% earned more than $70,000. Employment of social workers is expected to grow by 25% from 2010 to 2020, which is faster than the average for most occupations.
Social workers have a profound and far-reaching impact on our society. Social workers are found in every facet of community life and are employed throughout the mental health industry.






Socioeconomic status is a tool for identifying status based on individuals’ income and occupation in relation to others.

Description
Socioeconomic status looks at how people relate to each other based on their income, background, and occupation. Socioeconomic status is often referred to as SES. In the fields of social sciences, it is one of the most widely studied constructs.
Socioeconomic status is measured by looking at family income, parental education, and parental occu¬pation. This area is widely researched, as people want to know the impact and relation to physical health, mental health, and advantages or disadvantages for children based on the family’s SES.
Socioeconomic status is generally broken down and referred to as high, middle or low. It is often used interchangeably with the term “social class.” Families of low and high status tend to be focused on the most. Children born to low-status families tend to be con¬sidered behind those children of high status in relation to education and development. For instance, children of high-status families tend to learn words faster than those of low-status families, which is noticed in chil¬dren as young as 18 months old.
Research dating back to the early 1900s highlights the connection between family life and SES. Those with low SES face more hardship, which impacts parent–child relationships and family life. Those who are considered to be in the ethnic minority are more often considered part of low SES in the United States.
In relation to child development, the focus on SES has surrounded the concern that those who come from low SES lack access to resources, education, and care, leading to developmental problems and limited better future prospects regarding education and occupation. Education is a large focus point in regard to exploring
 

status, as many believe that education has a great influence on occupation and income later in life.
Studies have supported the idea that those coming from higher SES will have more opportunity for economic growth and occupation choices. Studies have also highlighted a connection that those of higher SES have decreased percentages of separation and divorce in their relationships as well as better parent–child relationships.




Sociopathic personality is a mental disorder characterized by amoral and criminal behavior and a diminished sense of moral responsibility. It is also known as sociopathy and sociopath.


•	Antisocial personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of disregarding and violating the rights of others.
•	DSM stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders. The current edition (fifth) is known as DSM-5.
 


 

•	Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.
•	Psychopathic personality is a mental disorder characterized by amoral behavior, inability to love and understand another’s feelings (empathy), extreme self-centeredness, and failure to learn from experience. It is also known as psychopathy and psychopath.



Individuals with sociopathic personality tend to spontaneously act out in inappropriate ways without thinking through the consequences. They may be nervous, easily agitated, and quick to display anger. They will lie, manipulate, and hurt others, but will often avoid doing so to the select few individuals they care about. Most often they are able to form attachments and loyalties to others. This means that they are likely to experience guilt and remorse when they hurt someone they care about. While they are capable of committing heinous crimes, they are unlikely to commit crimes against family or friends.
In the past, the term “sociopathic personality” has been used synonymously with psychopathic personal¬ity and antisocial personality disorder. More recently, clinicians and researchers favor distinguishing them. There appear to be differences among the three in both behavior and etiology (cause). While antisocial behavior is common in antisocial personality disorder and sociopathic personality, it is less common in psycho¬pathic personality. Also, there are specific deficits in psychopaths that distinguish them from sociopaths. These include interpersonal deficits, such as grandiosity, arrogance, and deceitfulness, as well as affective deficits, such as a lack of guilt. In addition, psychopaths are characterized with global deficits of empa¬thy. As for etiology, it appears that the psychopathic personality is more influenced by genetic inheritance than environment. In contrast, the sociopathic personality seems to be more influenced by environmental factors such as poverty, exposure to violence, and overly permissive or neglectful parenting. It should
 

also be noted that the second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders provided a description of the sociopathic personality. However, in subsequent editions, it has been replaced by a description and specific diagnostic criteria for the antisocial personality disorder.



Solution-focused brief therapy is a talking therapy that focuses on solutions rather than on problems.

Description
Solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT), also referred to as solution-focused therapy, is a talking therapy that focuses on the development of solutions rather than on past problems. SFBT is an evidence-based practice that minimizes emphasis on past failings and problems, and focuses on client’s strengths and previous and future successes.


The development of solution-focused brief therapy was led by husband and wife Steve de Shazer (1940–2005) and Insoo Kim Berg (1934–2007) at the Brief Family Therapy Center (BFTC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Finding that an excessive amount of time and energy was spent in thinking about, talking about, and analyzing problems, the team at BFTC developed a method to bring about
 


 

realistic change as quickly as possible. Since the conception of SFBT in the late 1970s, other therapists have added to its conceptual framework. Eve Lipchik, John Walter, and Jane Peller, have written extensively about solution-focused therapy. Michelle Weiner-Davis and Bill O’Hanlon, influenced by de Shazer and Berg’s work, expanded their own work and created solution-oriented therapy, which shares many key concepts with SFBT. Both de Shazer and Kim Berg wrote extensively on SFBT. With the passing of de Shazer and Kim Berg, the BFTC was closed and all rights to their solution-focused training materials were bequeathed and transferred to the Solution-Focused Brief Therapy Association.
Solution-focused brief therapy is a collaborative process that works from the client’s understanding of his or her concerns and what the client might want different. The therapeutic focus is on what the client desires for the future rather than on past problems or even current conflicts. One of the basic prem¬ises of SFBT is that there is no problem that happens all the time. SFBT uncovers “exceptions,” which are times when the problem could have happened but didn’t. The model assumes that exceptions are actually solution-oriented behaviors that already exist for the client. The nature of these exceptions is used by the client and therapist to co-construct future solutions. Clients are encouraged to increase the frequency of behaviors, which have led to solutions. Another key concept of SFBT is that small increments of change lead to large increments of change.
The therapist takes a positive, collaborative, and collegial position that assists the client in finding alternatives to current patterns of thinking, behaving, and interacting that are problematic. The focus of the therapist is on what is observable in the communication and social interactions between the client and the therapist. The mechanism of change is the dialogue between the therapist and client.
One of the main techniques utilized in SFBT is the “miracle question.” When clients have difficulty articulating a goal, the miracle question can help the client what may occur if a solution was found. Although there are many variations to the miracle questions, the basic question is, “Imagine that sometime during the night a miracle takes place and while you are asleep the problem you are talking about is solved. But because
 

you were asleep when it was solved when you wake up you don’t know a miracle has taken place. So when you wake up how will you know the problem is no longer a problem?” The miracle question has been so effective in assisting clients in the change process that it has been adopted and used in many other models of psychotherapy.

Current Status
Solution-focused brief therapy has been found to be an effective form of psychotherapy and is included in Substance Abuse Mental Health Service Administration’s National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices. It has been found to be helpful with both adult and adolescent populations and in both outpatient and inpatient treatment centers.




Somatic symptom disorder is a mental disorder characterized by bodily symptoms that are very distressing and result in disrupted functioning. In the past it was called somatization disorder.


•	DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
 


 

Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
•	External locus of control is the core belief that individuals’ decisions and life are controlled by external factors over which they have little or no influence.
•	Mindfulness practices are intentional activities that foster living in the present moment and awareness that is nonjudgmental and accepting.
•	Somatic sensitivity refers to the high level of sensitivity and attentiveness to bodily sensations in some individuals, leading them to overly focus on physical symptoms.
•	Somatic symptom and related disorders are a group of DSM-5 mental disorders characterized by prominent somatic symptoms and significant distress and impairment. They include somatic symptom disorder, factitious disorder, and conversion disorder.
•	Somatization disorder is a mental disorder characterized by multiple bodily symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition. This term is no longer used and has been replaced with somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5.
•	Stress management is a set of psychological techniques for increasing the capacity to better cope with psychological stress. It usually includes relaxation methods.


Somatic symptom disorder is one of the groups of disorders known as somatic symptom and related disorders. Individuals with this disorder experience somatic (bodily) symptoms that are very distressing and that significantly disrupt daily functioning. The duration and severity of these symptoms and the pursuit of relief often become the focal point of their lives. Talking about their condition often becomes the primary focus and way in which they relate with others. Their
 

suffering can also limit their ability to work or care for their children. Somatic symptom disorder is similar to but different from somatization disorder. Whereas somatization disorder required that symptoms could not be explained by a medical condition, somatic symptom disorder does not.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit one or more somatic (bodily) symptoms that disrupt their lives. The disruption and their response become problematic in that the person has excessive worry and anxiety regarding the seriousness of the symptoms regardless of the fact that medical evidence does not warrant it. These individuals may also expend considerable time and efforts focused on their symptoms. In addition, the symptoms must persist for more than six months (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
The cause of somatic symptom disorder is not well understood. It may be that those with this disorder are more sensitive to their bodily sensations (somatic sensitivity) than others. They tend to amplify and interpret these sensations are indicators of physical illness. As a result, when they experience emotional stress, they are likely to interpret it as a physical symptom. They tend to view life as threatening and overwhelming. They are also likely to view themselves as unable to control and deal with overwhelming circumstances. These views reflect an external locus of control. This disorder not only confirms and perpetuates their suffering but also explains their reliance and overuse of medical treatment.


Effective treatment of this disorder involves counseling or psychotherapy. Usually, these individuals are referred to psychotherapy by their physician. But, because they are likely to resist a psychological explana¬tion and treatment for their condition, a team approach is essential if treatment is to be successful. Framing treatment as a team approach lets these individuals know that the therapist will work with their physician, as part of a team, to reduce their suffering. Psychological treatment should emphasize increasing functioning decreasing preoccupation with symptoms. Interven¬tion strategies should target physical functioning by
 


 

teaching relaxation and other stress management skills. Such interventions can greatly help them feel better physically and increase their sense of self-efficacy. In addition, mindfulness practice can help in reducing their preoccupation with and acceptance of physical symptoms.

Somatizing personality disorder (SPD) is a mental dis¬order characterized by a persistent and excessive pre¬occupation with bodily concerns.

Definitions
•	Alexithymia is the inability to experience, express, identify, and describe emotional responses.
•	Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.
•	Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that persist despite contrary evidence.
•	Hypochondriasis is a mental condition characterized by a preoccupation with having a serious medical condition based on a misinterpretation of bodily symptoms.
•	Personality disorder is a long-standing pattern of maladaptive (problematic) behaviors,
 

thoughts, and emotions that deviates from the accepted norms of an individual’s culture.

Somatizing personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by an excessive preoccupation with bodily concerns that is ongoing and long-standing. Individuals with this disorder typically experience health concerns that doctors can’t explain. As a result these individuals become frustrated and come to believe that others do not understand and accept their concerns. Being preoccupied with bodily concerns can lead indi¬viduals to experience a delusion. The delusion may involve a belief that a part of their body has been injured or altered in some way. Individuals with SPD often present a confusing combination of concerns. Other issues include having a diagnosable stress-related physical illness and bodily symptoms that express ideas and emotions that are too painful to put into words (PDM Task Force, 2006).
Individuals with SPD are also characterized by alexithymia. Children who cannot verbalize their feelings tend to either act out or complain they have body aches and pains. Individuals with this disorder have also been described as lacking the ability to fantasize and being incompetent in symbolic expres¬sion. They tend to invest more time in “things” than in the effects of the imagination (PDM Task Force, 2006). It is possible that early caregivers of individ¬uals with this disorder did not encourage express¬ing feelings and emotions. Therefore, this left their bodies to communicate what their minds could not. Although they may at times receive some secondary gain from the sick role, the pain they suffer is real and debilitating. Individuals with this personality disorder often claim that they feel that nobody is listening to them. Others may tune out individuals with SPD as previous efforts to help them left them feeling frustrated due to a lack of resolving the problem. Individuals with this personality disorder may
 


 

also feel “unheard” because of the early experiences with caregivers who failed to respond to their communication. This personality disorder tends to significantly interfere with relationships, school, work, and social activities. It is important to distinguish SPD from hypochondriasis. Both involve a preoccupation with medical concerns. The lives of those with SPD are totally dominated by these concerns. However, it is less likely that hypochondriasis interferes with daily activities and relationships.
According to the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual, SPD is diagnosable by the following criteria. It is common for individuals with this disorder to have a developmental history that includes early sickliness. It might also include being physically fragile and early physical or sexual abuse. These individuals tend to be preoccupied with something being wrong with their bodies. They commonly exhibit distress and rage. Alexithymia prevents them from acknowledging their emotions. Their basic belief is they are vulnerable, fragile, and in danger of dying. Their view of others is that they are healthy, powerful, and indifferent. Furthermore, their main way of defending themselves is by regressing (returning to a previous or usually worse state) and continually expressing they have body aches and pains (PDM Task Force, 2006).



Treatment of this disorder requires a supportive relationship with both a health-care provider (physician) and a mental health-care provider (therapist). Cognitive behavior therapy has been shown to be particularly effective for SPD. This approach can assist an individual in dealing with pain and helping him or her realize his or her health concern is not fatal. Effective therapy involves such individuals talking about their concerns and their therapists listening and acknowledging these concerns in a caring manner.
 




“Somatopsychic” refers to the influence of the body on the mind. It is the opposite of psychosomatic, which refers to the effect of the mind on the body.

•	Depressive disorder due to another medical condition is depression that occurs as the result of a physical illness. The depression causes substantial difficulty in social, occupational, and interpersonal areas.
•	DSM-5 is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It is the handbook mental health professionals use to diagnose mental disorders.
•	Major depressive disorder is a DSM-5 mental disorder characterized by a depressed mood and other symptoms that interfere significantly with an individual’s daily functioning. It is also referred to as clinical depression.
•	Psychosomatic refers to the effects of mental processes on physical health.


Somatopsychic is the relationship of the body and mind. It refers to the effect that physical bodily conditions have on mental processes, in other words, how physical health impacts mental health. Mental disorders such as depression and anxiety may be symptoms of physical illness or mental dysfunction. For example, the underlying cause of depression may be attributable
 


 

to a physical illness such as cancer. According to the DSM-5, the depression will be diagnosed as depressive disorder due to another medical condition and not as major depressive disorder. One of the criteria for major depressive disorder explicitly states that the depressive episode cannot be the result of a medical condition. The depression is the direct result of the physical illness and cannot be attributed to another mental disorder.
The interrelationship between body and mind makes it difficult for a physician or clinician to determine whether the presenting problem is somatopsychic or psychosomatic. It may be that both body-mind and mind-body play a role in symptom development. It is im¬portant for mental health clinicians, and especially physicians, to keep in mind that psychological symptoms could potentially be the result of physical illness. Conversely, it is important to remember that physical symptoms may be caused by psychological illness. Attentiveness to these possibilities can lead to more accurate diagnoses.
There are many physical conditions that are expressed through psychological symptoms. This is why it is crucial for mental health clinicians to rule out organic conditions as possible causes for psychological symptoms. A thorough history assessment is necessary to determine if an individual needs to be referred for a physical examination. It is important to ask when an in¬dividual was last seen by a physician, what type of exam was performed, what lab tests were performed, and what the results indicated. When a diagnosis is not clear, it is important to maintain awareness of the possibility that organic causes may be at the root of the problem.
The effects of the body on the mind were originally explored by early psychiatrists such as Christian Friedrich Nasse (1778–1851), Carl Friedrich Flemming (1799–1880), and Pavel Ivanovich Jacobi (1841–1913). These physicians were part of the somatic school and contended that psychological dysfunction was a symptom of biological diseases in the body. They believed that physical illness created an imbalance in the relationship between the body and mind.
 





South Park is an American animated television program intended for mature audiences, televised on the Comedy Central cable network.

South Park debuted in August 1997 and was created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Parker and Stone are the show’s lead writers and producers and provide the voices of the main characters. Production took place at South Park Studios (SPS) in Culver City, California. South Park has received numerous awards and is known for its vulgarity, crude humor, strong profanity, dark satire, shock value, running gags, and pop-culture references. TV guide ranked South Park as the 10th greatest television cartoon of all time.
South Park is set in the fictionalized town of South Park Colorado and follows the strange adventures of four foul-mouthed boys in elementary school: Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick. Stan Marsh, described as the average fourth grader is modeled after Parker. Kyle, modeled after Stone, is described as the voice of reason, is Jewish, and is Stan’s best friend. Eric Cartman is described as one of the worst human beings in the history of fiction and the most famous of the fourth graders. He is narcissist, self-centered, racist, and obese. Kenny is poor and, according to SPS, tends to frequently die and was killed in innumerable ways during the first five seasons.
South Park Studios has a staff of approximately 70 people. The use of cutout animation software allows for episodes to be produced the week of the airing. The production schedules allow for current events to be rapidly incorporated into episodes. Some episodes
 



portrayal of religion for comic effect is a frequent complaint, as is the use of profanity. Adding to the controversies, South Park frequently responds to criticism by producing shows containing more of whatever is being complained about. For instance, in response to com¬plaints regarding the use of profanity, SPS released “It hits the fan” the first episode of season five (2005). During that episode the word “shit” is said 162 times uncensored.
Since its television debut in 1997 South Park has been the topic of countless college papers and has added many catchphrases to our cultural language. With its political incorrectness, satirizing of many of the world’s most popular religions (Christianity, Mormonism, Islam, Scientology), and negative depictions of political leaders, South Park has generated worldwide controversy since its debut in 1997. South Park remains one of the most highly rated animated television programs of all time.

Special Education
 

disabilities include but are not limited to learning, emotional, behavioral, and communication disorders, physical impairments, and/or sensory needs. Students may become eligible for special education services after properly being diagnosed with one or more of
 
		these disorders. Those who receive special education support may be described as “special needs” or Special education provides teaching instruction for students diagnosed with learning, behavioral, emotional, communicative, developmental, and physical disabilities, in specifically designed educational settings that meet their individual needs.

•	Inclusion is an educational approach that calls for students who are disabled to spend the majority of time in classrooms with nondisabled peers.
•	Learning disability, or specific learning disability (SLD), is a neurological disorder that affects the brain and results in processing, reading, writing, reasoning, and recalling difficulties.
•	Mainstreaming refers to the inclusion of students with special needs into regular, general education classrooms and activities.
•	Response to intervention, also known as Multi-Tier System of Supports, is an approach used to provide students displaying academic and behavioral concerns with appropriate instruction and intervention.
•	Special needs is a term used to describe persons who have been diagnosed with mental, emotional, and physical disabilities.



Traditional classrooms, referred to as “general education” classrooms, provide education programs for typically developing students based on state standards as determined by state standardized achievement tests. Special education services are designed to supplement the regular curriculum and support the unique needs of students with qualified disabilities. Those
 
“learning disabled”. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), now the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, mandates that children aged 3 to 21 with special needs receive a free and appropriate education in the least restrictive environment. Inclusion in general education classrooms with nondisabled peers should therefore be executed to the greatest extent possible. Evidence suggests that when disabled peers are mainstreamed, they experience positive outcomes. By providing proper support and services, educational systems seek to promote student well-being, self-sufficiency, and future success. Special education support can occur within traditional classrooms, resource rooms, self-contained classroom, or specialized schools. Reading and math instruction; speech-language, occupational, and physical therapies small group counseling and behavioral interventions may be offered.
Students who are born with noticeable disabilities or impairments ( deafness, blindness, physical handicap) may be easily identified and thus begin their school careers with special support. However, other students, primarily those with specific learning disabilities (SLDs), require proper identification, evaluation, and diagnosis. The process for qualifying for special education support can be lengthy. Traditionally, a full psychoeducational evaluation by a licensed psychologist is required. Qualifying for an SLD is then determined based on the discrepancy model—whether or not there is significant difference, at least two standard deviations (30 points) between the individual’s scores on an achievement test and his or her IQ. However, this model has been criticized as it does not provide a method for identifying children in primary grades, provides little information about the student’s specific learning needs, and has resulted in disproportionate representation of minority groups. The recent introduction of an alternative approach, Response to Intervention, has placed heavy demands on educational
 


 

staff, primarily classroom teachers, to document and provide interventions aimed at meeting students’ individualized needs. Each student with a documented disability is required to have an Individualized Education Plan/Program (IEP) on file outlining his or her specific needs, goals, and services received. IEPs are then tailored to each individual and describe both accommo¬dations and modifications to the general curriculum. Accommodations are slight adjustments to the regular education that simply change the format in order to make it more palatable for the student, while modifications change or reduce the curriculum to bring it to a level that is obtainable for the student.


Parents advocating for specialized schooling and sup¬port for their children can be traced back to the 1930s. however, over the next several decades slow progress was made toward advancing the rights of children with special needs. The 1950s and 1960s and the in¬fluence of the civil rights movement had a positive ef¬fect. Specifically, the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education (1952) established precedence that segregating students based on race was unconstitutional, paving the way for other marginalized groups to fol¬low. It was not until the 1970s that true educational reform benefiting disabled youth began. The federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was the first piece of leg¬islation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of dis¬ability. In 1975, Congress enacted the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, mandating that specialized programs and services be made available to those who need them; that students who qualified for these services be guaranteed free, equal, and appropriate education; that specific monitoring procedures and policies for these programs be established; and that federal funds be allotted to support these efforts. This law has since became known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act after being signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 30, 1990. IDEA has been reauthorized several times, most recently in 2004. One of the key provisions calls for the creation of an IEP for every student who qualifies under the law for special services. Presently, increased emphasis has been placed on accountability standards,
 

primarily in response to No Child Left Behind, and the required hiring of “highly qualified teachers” who are best able to meet the needs of those most vulnerable.


The Department of Education reports that over 6 million school-age children are receiving some type of special education support. This percentage has increased over the past several years mostly due to early intervention and proper identification. Debate continues over the disproportionate number of minority students who are targeted for services. Research suggests that the overrepresentation of certain ethnic groups may be at¬tributed to lack of exposure to preschool foundational concepts, inadequate home support, and higher rates of reported behavior problems among these subgroups. In addition, reduced funding and a shortage of good teachers in underprivileged schools are also contributors.



Specific learning disorder is a group of mental disorders characterized by specific deficits in the ability to under¬stand and process information effectively and correctly.


•	DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
 


 

Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
•	Learning disorders are neurological disorders that can make it difficult for an individual to acquire certain academic and social skills.
•	Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of DSM-5 disorders characterized by early life deficits that produce impaired personal, social, academic, or job functioning. These include autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and specific learning disorder.
•	Specifiers are extensions to a diagnosis that further clarifies the course, severity, or type of features of a disorder or illness.



Specific learning disorder is one of the DSM-5 neurodevelopmental disorders. It is characterized by continuous and impairing problems with learning fundamental skills in writing, reading, or math. This results in academic performance that is well below average for their age. The disorder occurs when the learning demands or evaluation procedures (e.g., timed tests) create obstacles that cannot be overcome by their natural intelligence and compensatory strategies. Specific learning disorder results in lifelong impairments (e.g., job performance) for individuals affected by this disorder.
The occurrence of this disorder across the academic areas of writing, reading, and mathematics is 5%–15% among school-age children. This includes children who speak different languages and are from different cultural backgrounds. The occurrences of this disorder in adults are not exactly known, but estimates indicate being approximately 4% (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they experience problems with learning and academic skills with at least one of the following symptoms. These symptoms include inaccurate or slow word reading, problems
 

understanding what the meaning of what is read, and problems with spelling and written expression. Additional symptoms include problems mastering sense of numbers, calculation, and number facts, and problems with mathematical reasoning. Symptoms of this disorder must occur for at least six months. In addition, academic skills must be significantly below what is expected for an individual’s chronological age. Individuals with this disorder experience significant interference with academic and occupational performance. The learning problems must have begun during school-age years. The learning problems are not better accounted for by other neurological or mental disorders or a lack of skill in the language of academic or educational instruction. Specifiers must be included in this diagnosis if an individual has impairment with reading, written expression, or mathematics. The current level of severity of this disorder must also be specified in making this diagnosis. The levels include mild, moderate, and severe (American Psychiatric Associa¬tion, 2013).
The exact cause of this disorder may be due to
environmental and genetic factors. For example, individuals born prematurely have an increased risk for having this disorder. Individuals are more likely to have this disorder if their first-degree relatives have been diagnosed with this disorder. In addition, indi¬viduals who had a delay in speech or language during preschool years are likely to be diagnosed with this disorder.


Children diagnosed with this learning disorder can qualify for special education services. Experts can help a child learn skills by building on the child’s strengths and develop ways to make up for his or her weaknesses. Specific treatment techniques may vary depending on whether the individual is struggling with reading, writing, or mathematics. The earlier an individual receives help, the more likely he or she will be successful in school and later in life.
 


 





Specific phobia is a mental disorder characterized by a marked and enduring fear of specific situations or objects. Previously this disorder was referred to as simple phobia.

•	Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorder characterized by anxiety as a central or core symptom. The group includes specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.
•	Behavior therapy is a psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors. It is also referred to as behavioral therapy.
•	Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (faulty) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.
•	DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.
•	Exposure therapy is a type of behavior therapy that involves repeated actual, simulated, or visualized exposure to a feared object, situation, or traumatic event that reduces fear and anxiety.
•	Social anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive and unreasonable fear in social situations of being judged or
 

evaluated by others. Previously it was referred to as social phobia.



Specific phobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by a persistent and unreasonable fear of presence or thought of a specific object or situation. However, it must be noted that the object or situation poses little or no actual danger. Yet exposure to the object or situation leads to an immediate reaction in which an indi¬vidual experiences intense anxiety or avoids the object or situation entirely. This distress, or the need to avoid the object or situation, significantly interferes with the individual’s ability to function. Adults with this dis¬order recognize that their fear is unreasonable but are unable to overcome it. Others may view those with this disorder as introverts or self-absorbed because of the amount of attention they put on the fear of either avoiding or having to engage in a situation that is causing the fear. A related disorder is social anxiety disorder in which the fear is of being judged or evaluated by other individuals.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit excessive anxiety or fear about an object or situation. Children with these disorders may express their fear in a multitude of flight or fight behaviors, including tantrums, crying, or clinging. The fear is avoided at multiple costs, is persistent, lasts at least six months, and is out of proportion to the actual risk or danger. Specific phobias are coded according to the feared stimulus (animal, natural environment, blood injection injury, situations, etc.) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
DSM-5 describes the following types of specific phobias.

•	Animal phobias. These phobias involve a fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Animal pho¬bias are the most common specific phobias.
•	Natural environment phobias. These phobias involve a fear of storms, water, bridges, or heights.
 


 

•	Blood-injection-injury phobias. These phobias involve a fear of medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections, of seeing blood, or of being injured.
•	Situation-specific phobias. These phobias involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, driving a car, riding in a car or on public transportation, going over bridges or in tunnels, or being in a closed-in place such as an elevator.
•	Other phobias. These phobias involve a fear of choking or vomiting. Among children the fears are of loud sounds, of falling down, and of costumed characters, such as clowns.

The likelihood of experiencing this disorder in one’s lifetime is about 8%. It is twice as common (16%) among those between the ages of 13 and 17, but much less common (4%) in the elderly. Women are twice as likely as men to report phobic experiences. Of the various phobias, women are more likely to experience animal, situation-specific, and natural environment phobias (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
The cause of this disorder is not well understood. Often, there is no explanation for the development of a specific phobia. However, the cause may be traced to a traumatic experience or may develop from a general tendency to be anxious. It usually begins in childhood when exposure to a feared object or situation results in an immediate anxiety response. Experiencing a traumatic event, such as being bitten by a dog, could trigger the development of a phobia. Also, a child may learn phobias by observing a family member’s phobic reac¬tion to an object or a situation, such as a fear of dogs.


The clinical treatment of this disorder usually involves exposure therapy. Gradual, repeated exposure to the feared object or situation helps individuals to conquer their fear and reduce their anxiety. Cognitive behavior therapy is also used to learn to view and cope with the feared object or situation differently. It focuses on developing a sense of mastery and control over one’s thoughts and feelings.
 


Speech-language pathology is a branch of medical treatment to assess, diagnose, treat, and help people who cannot produce speech sounds correctly or clearly.


Speech-language pathologists (SLPs), sometimes called speech therapists, help people with a variety of communication or speech disorders. This includes those who suffer from speech delays and deficits or an inability to speak well because of physical speech limitations. Therapy will include a variety of strategies to improve speech, promote communication through alternative methods, and help with the motor movements of the mouth overall. Speech-language pathology can be observed in both communication disorders and swallowing disorders. These difficulties are often medically linked to swallowing deficits, which also have their origin or effects in the throat region. When speech is the issue, the focus is on the elements of speech production, which include vocalizing or producing sound, tone, and pitch. When swallowing is the issue, the focus is on the physical components of respiration or breathing.
Speech-language pathologists are trained to screen and diagnose different types of speech-language disorders. They work with individuals and their families (especially those on the autism spectrum) to thoroughly understand the issues before helping choose appropriate intervention strategies and delivery models.
 


 

As a distinct endeavor speech-language therapy has existed since the days of Annie Sullivan, who worked with Helen Keller, and Lionel Logue, who worked with King George V. Outside of education and general rehabilitation it became a specialty in the American medical field after George L. Larsen began to do important diagnostic work at the VA hospital in Seattle in the 1960s. He was
 



Speech Sound Disorder
 
especially skillful at relating swallowing problems to		
 
nervous system impairments, and he pioneered a team approach to speech and swallowing-related issues.
The original focus of speech-language pathology was on those with severe physical vocal restrictions and other language-related issues. The need for this occurred when war veterans after both World War I and World War II returned and required help. It has broadened to include individuals who suffer from the in¬ability to use language with proper meaning as well as those who suffer from problems with the social aspects of communication. This latter group includes many individuals with a variety of developmental and learning disorders. The field of speech-language pathology became increasingly specialized, including formal certification. Today, certified speech therapist professionals work in both medical and educational settings.

Today the field of speech-language pathology is well established. There are over 120,000 SLPs in the United States about equally divided between those who work in schools and those who work directly in clinical settings. SLPs who have been trained in the reliable and valid use of diagnostic and assessment tools are qualified to identify a variety of language and speech disorders. They are used frequently as independent or private practitioners who help plan a course of treatment to improve a variety of speech, language, and swallowing disorders.
 
Speech sound disorder (SSD) is described as a difficulty with or delay in the development of speech.


Speech sound disorder is a general category that includes many disorders such as articulation disorder, phonological disorder, and childhood apraxia of speech. They are also referred to as speech impairments or speech difficulties. Specifically, SSD affects children’s ability to develop easily understood speech by the time they are about four years old.
In 2008, the American Speech Language Association created separate definitions for different SSDs. It described articulation disorders versus phonological disorders. Articulation disorder includes problems with developing speech sounds. This includes motor speech control issues so that the child will say “yeth” for “yes” where he or she does not yet have the muscle motor control to make the sound. Phonological disorder is comprised of errors that develop into a pattern of speech problems. This disorder has an emphasis on the inability to grasp and apply differences in sound. One example is using “tat” for “cat.” In the case of phonological disorder, it is not only articulation that is the problem. it is also the ability to understand and use words well. Other people usually have a difficult time understanding a child with phonological disorder.
If children have poor speech when they start school at about five or six years old, it is likely that their peers and teachers will have difficulty understanding them. It can also negatively impact their ability to learn reading and spelling. About 5% of preschool children are diagnosed with SSD. It is more common in boys than in girls.
 
Problems or changes in the structure or shape of the muscles and bones in the head and neck may cause SSD. These are the muscles and bones that are used to make speech sounds. These changes may include cleft palate and problems with the teeth. Another cause can be damage to parts of the brain or the nerves that control how the muscles and other structures work to create speech.
In some cases the cause of phonological disorder in children is unknown. Close relatives may have had speech and language problems. Multiple languages and poor pronunciation at home can complicate the issue.


Children with SSD will substitute, leave off, or change sounds. These errors may make it hard for other people to understand them. Only family members may be able to understand a child who has a very severe phonological speech disorder.
Commonly, children with this disorder have problems with words that begin with two consonants. “Friend” becomes “fiend” and “spoon” becomes “soon.” There may also be problems with words that have a certain sound, such as words with k, g, or r. They may either leave them out or not pronounce them clearly, or replace them with a different sound.
It is common for children to have problems pronouncing words while their speech is developing. However, by age three, it is thought that at least half of what a child says should be understandable by a stranger. By the beginning of school, age five or six, a child’s speech should be mostly intelligible to everyone.

Speech sound disorder should be diagnosed and treated by certified speech-language pathologists. The approach to treatment of SSD is based on principles that emphasize several things. It is important to look into the nature of the SSD with a focus on the person’s language skills in combination with his or her motor abilities. It also includes the building of activities that support the child in developing a way to organize his or
 

her speech. This aims to help the child generalize and apply what he or she has learned to other situations. To do this many other therapies may apply, which are core vocabulary therapy, cycles therapy, and imagery therapy.
Before any course of treatment is chosen, children should be examined for other problems. These problems include intellectual disabilities, hearing impairment, neurological problems, and physical conditions such as a cleft palate. In examining each case it is important to evaluate whether relatives have similar problems, and whether more than one language is spoken in the home. In all cases a comprehensive evaluation will help refine the treatment decisions and increase the likelihood of a child’s success.



Spiritual awakening is a life-changing experience in the way an addicted individual thinks and acts. This experience often includes improved mood and increased spirituality.


•	Abstinence is the restraint of indulging oneself in bodily activities that typically gives an individual pleasure (e.g., alcohol and drugs).
 


 

•	Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain, which involves compulsive and uncontrolled pursuit of reward or relief with substance use or other compulsive behaviors.
•	Addiction recovery is the state of abstinence from addictive behaviors, usually achieved through self-reflection and spiritual exploration.
•	Alcoholics Anonymous is a self-help fellowship that was founded by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in 1935 to help people struggling with alcoholism.
•	Drug abstinence is when an individual completely discontinues drug or alcohol use for a given period of time.
•	Higher power is a term used in Alcoholics Anonymous to refer to a “power greater than ourselves.” It can include a god, deity, nature, or anything beyond the individual.
•	Narcotics Anonymous is a self-help and support group for those addicted to drugs to help them learn how to live without the use of mind and mood-altering chemicals. It is a Twelve-Step Program.
•	Spirituality is the sum of an individual’s unique worldview and self-view, religious beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.
•	Twelve-Step Program is a self-help group whose members attempt recovery from various addictions based on a plan called the Twelve Steps.
•	Twelve Steps refer to the 12 guiding principles on which Alcoholics Anonymous is based.
Spiritual awakening is a major shift in the way an individual struggling with addiction thinks and acts. This change can include abstinence from drugs and alcohol, improved mood and physical health, heightened spirituality, and increased service to others. The term is used synonymously with spiritual experience.
 

The experience is often triggered by a major conflict or “hitting bottom.” As a result, individuals who have this experience often report reduced drug or alcohol cravings, abstinence, increased voluntary service, and increased positive mood states. In some cases, the experience can lead to an individual achieving complete recovery from addiction. This experience is clearly spiritual in nature and may or may not involve religion. The term “spiritual awakening” was originally used in 1939 in the first edition of the Twelve-Step text called “the big book” of Alcoholics Anonymous, which is titled Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How Many Thousands of Men and Women Have Recovered from Alcoholism. The book was written primarily by Bill W., also known as William Griffith Wilson (1895–1971), who is one of the founding members of Alcoholics Anonymous. The book is for individuals who are working a Twelve-Step Program to manage their addiction to drugs or alcohol. Millions of individuals have sought help for their drug or alcohol addiction by entering Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous to seek support. Participation in Twelve-Step support groups includes engaging in the Twelve-Step protocol, attending frequent meetings, volunteering for services, and believing in a “higher power.” The term “spiritual awakening” is the 12th step of the Twelve Steps. The step is identified as “Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.”
Research has studied the experience of spiritual awakening and examined traits that characterize the triggering event context and the common reactions of the experience of individuals who are in recovery from drugs or alcohol . This concept is a significant component among the field of addiction, Twelve Steps, and spirituality.
 


 




Spiritual bypass is the process of avoiding uncomfortable psychological issues by focusing on spiritual matters.

Definitions
•	Addiction recovery is the state of abstinence from addictive behaviors, usually achieved through self-reflection and spiritual exploration.
•	Defense mechanisms are strategies for self-protection against anxiety and other negative emotions that accompany stress.
•	New Age spirituality is a spiritual movement whose purpose is for individuals to reach their highest potential. It rejects religious doctrine and promotes individual ways of attaining truth.
•	Religion is a spiritual belief system shared by many individuals that may include specific rules, practices, and institutions.
•	Spirituality is the sum of an individual’s unique worldview and self-view, religious beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.


Spiritual bypass is a way to avoid dealing with emotional, developmental, and relationship problems. The term “spiritual bypassing” was first used in 1984 by psychologist John Welwood  and has since been explored by others. Those who use spiritual
 

bypass tend to focus on spiritual issues and practices rather than on the psychological or emotional problems that they experience as threatening. Spiritual issues include abstract ideas like “faith,” while specific practices include prayer and meditation. Psychological issues that are avoided may include feelings of anger and sadness, relationship problems, or lack of direction.
Those who use spiritual bypass may appear to be psychologically healthy because of their focus on spirituality. In reality, spiritual bypass leads to underdeveloped coping skills with the result that individuals are less effective in dealing with everyday problems. An example of spiritual bypass is a wife praying about forgiveness in response to her husband’s repeated verbal abuse. Rather than address her hurt feelings or the abuse directly, she “bypasses” them using spirituality. As a result, she misses the opportunity to develop new skills that may lead to a better relationship with him. Spiritual bypassing is like taking a shortcut to avoid traffic only to arrive right back where one started.
Interestingly, those using spiritual bypass are likely to have a simplistic and shallow sense of spirituality. In addition, they tend to have an exaggerated sense of detachment from “worldly” problems and blindly follow spiritual rules or practices without question. They may overemphasize positive feelings like happiness and well-being while fearing negative feelings. They are also likely to have relationship problems. These include isolation, people pleasing, and “holier-than-thou” behavior. Spiritual bypass has become increasingly common since the rise of New Age spirituality in the 1960s. It is also common in addiction recovery, which emphasizes spirituality.
This avoidance strategy can be difficult to recognize because spiritual development is generally seen as a healthy and desirable pursuit. What may appear as a positive behavior, such as volunteering at a homeless shelter, can be used to avoid negative feelings like inadequacy or guilt. The way to change spiritual bypass, once it is recognized, is to face difficult or unpleasant emotions and experiences. Counseling can be helpful in this process.
 


 



“Spiritual identity” refers to how one relates to, experiences, and incorporates spirituality into their personal sense of self.


•	Divine refers to objects, practices, and experiences associated with God, gods, or a supreme being.
•	Deity means a god or a supreme being.
•	Religion refers to the beliefs, doctrines, and practices associated with membership in a specific religious institution.
•	Sacred refers to revered objects, practices, or experiences that are considered holy or divine by religious individuals.
•	Transcendence refers to the perception that there are extraordinary dimensions to life that go beyond the limits of our physical reality.

The human experience consists of moral, social, physical, psychological, and spiritual dimensions. All individuals experience some form of spiritual hunger and a desire for self-transcendence that manifest in a search for meaning and purpose. This search results in the
 

development of a spiritual identity that impacts all of the dimensions of life. An individual’s spiritual identity will impact how events, experiences, and challenges are responded to. A person’s spiritual identity may be expressed through an organized religion but may also be expressed in many other ways. Researchers have noted that in the last quarter of the 20th century Americans have been moving away from traditional religious expressions and seeking a spiritual direction outside of religious traditions to find meaning, purpose, and a sense of inner fulfillment to their lives.
There are multiple conceptions of just how a person’s spiritual identity is formed. Douglas Mac-Donald, a psychologist and researcher of spirituality, conducted a large-scale analysis using data from 1,400 participants and identified five clear factors, or dimensions, related to spiritual development and identity. The first factor is a person’s cognitive orientation, or beliefs about spiritual matters, the transcendent, and how personally relevant these beliefs are. The second factor is what kind of spiritual experiences the person has had. The third factor is a person’s sense of existential well-being, or his or her sense of purpose and meaning, and how he or she copes with uncertainty such as the meaning of death. The fourth factor is belief in the paranormal. The fifth factor is religiousness and his or her belief in the existence of a higher power/ intelligence and how sincere these beliefs are.
Other conceptions of spiritual identity view the process as a spiritual journey that shares common themes. Hope provides a sense that difficult or painful experiences have meaning and are not in vain. Hope allows individuals to endure hardship and look toward a better future. Virtue and character is the power to live a genuine life as a unique individual with a sense of social-minded obligation toward others. The search for the sacred or holy in an attitude of receptivity to what the future may bring and of how the divine within would emerge in wholeness of self is part of the spiritual journey. Spiritual identity involves reconciling polarities and ambiguity such as good and evil, happiness and sorrow, life and death. It also calls for balance of activity and patience, contemplation and action, self and others. Facing oneself by confronting the difference between the real self and the ideal self is an important part of one’s spiritual identity. Compassion,
 


 

love, and forgiveness are vital spiritual themes that assist a person in being tolerant, empathic, helpful, and caring. The process of developing spiritual meaning in life is central to a sense of spiritual peace and well-being. Transcendence and going beyond ordinary or personal limits, feeling a sense of spiritual union and self-forgetfulness, is another characteristic of spiritual development and identity.
Spirituality is highly related to psychological well-being, and one’s spiritual identity impacts how one interprets events and responds to stress. Spirituality and spiritual identity is related to a one’s sense of meaning and purpose, hope and optimism, and social connectedness.


“Spirituality” refers to one’s sense of awareness and connection with the divine, sacred, transcendent, Supreme Being, or higher power.

•	Deity means a god or a supreme being.
•	Divine refers to objects, practices, and experiences associated with God, gods, or a supreme being.
 

•	Religion refers to the beliefs, doctrines, and practices associated with membership in a specific religious institution.
•	Rituals are a series or sequence of actions and behaviors performed in a specific order.
•	Sacred is defined as those things that are holy, “set apart,” and include objects, rites, and rituals.
•	Transcendence refers to the perception that there are extraordinary dimensions to life that go beyond the limits of our physical reality.


An individual’s search for meaning, fulfillment, purpose, and ways of coping with problems often involves a spiritual journey. Interest in spirituality within the professional mental health communities has grown steadily over the past three decades. The role a person’s spirituality plays in an individual’s sense of self, well-being, and healthy functionality has been the focus of attention by both clinicians and researchers. Spiritual issues most often surface as a result of loss, conflicts, or health problems. because of events that cause a crisis in faith such as victimization, betrayal, or the sudden death of a loved one; or as a desire to increase well-being.
There are many perspectives on spirituality, and definitions continue to evolve over time. A person’s spirituality should not be confused with being religious. The word “religion” is more frequently being associated with specific faith institutions and the beliefs, doctrines, and practices that express that religion. Religious practices include attending worship services, praying, reading holy text, singing, and other acts of devotion. A person’s religious orientation, or religiousness, may be “intrinsic” or “extrinsic.” A person with an intrinsic religious orientation participates in religious activities as a sincere form of worship in order to express his or her faith and devotion. The person’s religion is a positive motivating force resulting in personal growth and increased well-being. A person with an extrinsic religious orientation may participate in religious practices but only because he or she gets something out of it, such as feeling good about
 


 

himself or herself, social gain such as meeting potential business clients, or the approval of others such as parents or teachers. Their religion is not a motivating or growth-promoting force. An example of this would be the politician who attends church in order to get the votes of religious people.
Spirituality is a complex concept, and although there is no consensus definition, it is possible to identify common components to most conceptualizations. Spirituality is universal and innate, spontaneous and developmental, private and highly personal. It is both an emotional and intellectual pursuit. Spirituality involves the capacity to seek out and transcend one’s physical reality in order to experience the sacred in a search for meaning, purpose, and connectedness. Spirituality positively impacts a person’s sense of well-being, as well as his or her mental, emotional, and physical health. Researchers have found that spirituality and intrinsic religiosity are linked to greater longevity, positive health outcomes, better Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy.

Spiritual wellness and a clear sense of spiritual identity can provide a consistent theme for one’s life; a sense of connection to others as well as to the transcendent; and a sense of purpose, motivation, and vitality. Spiritual practices include prayer in order to express thoughts, needs, and attitudes toward the divine or sacred; meditation in order to reduce stress, find peace, or connect to the transcendent; use of ritual such as communion or purification ceremony; spiritual journaling providing a way to express, ponder, and develop spiritual insights; and bibliotherapy or reading spiritual texts. Practicing spiritual disciplines include forgiveness of self and others; confession in which one acknowledges one’s wrongdoings or transgressions; and surrender that involves relinquishing the need to control others and acceptance of the direction of one’s life. Spirituality is an important aspect of an individual’s search for meaning, fulfillment, and purpose. Developing a clear sense of spirituality can increase well-being, enhance abilities to cope, and provide a sense of connectedness to others and to the greater whole.
 
Spiritually oriented psychotherapy is a form of psychotherapy that is sensitive to spiritual, religious, and life meaning considerations.


Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior.
Religion refers to the search for significance through the sacred. It typically involves dogma (belief system) and rituals, which often are communal.
Spirituality refers to the search that reflects one’s deepest desires and the ways in which individuals think, feel, act, and relate in their efforts to find, conserve, and transform the sacred in their lives.

Believing that spirituality is vital for growth and essential for dealing with life’s problems, many individuals are pursuing a journey of spiritual growth. Pursuing this
 


 

journey typically involves a commitment to engaging in spiritual practices such as prayer and meditation. As a result of this pursuit, some are finding their lives are more centered and fulfilling, whereas others are finding themselves trapped in old feelings, attitudes, and habits that appear to undo their progress. Even those who have made progress on the journey often encounter spiritual and psychological roadblocks to growth. For a number of reasons, many individuals are turning to psychotherapy rather than to ministers, rabbis, and other spiritual guides for spiritual advice. In addition, those who are already in conventional psychotherapy expect that therapy will focus on their spiritual concerns.
Spiritually oriented psychotherapy is psychotherapy that is sensitive to spiritual, religious, and life meaning considerations whether it is formally designed as spiritually oriented psychotherapy or not. Spiritual considerations include the individual’s relationship with God or higher power, prayer life, and spiritual practices as well as involvement in a faith community. Religious considerations include one’s beliefs about God, faith, doctrine, salvation, denominational affiliation, and the afterlife. Unlike psychotherapy, personality change is not usually a goal of pastoral counseling. Life meaning considerations include one’s purpose or calling in life and one’s sense of belonging and connection with others.
There are three clinical contexts in psychotherapy in which religious, spiritual, and life meaning considerations are likely to surface. The first context is a spiritual resource for coping with a serious health problem, personal or professional loss, or interpersonal conflict, for example, situations involving betrayal and death of a child. The second context is a sense of loss resulting in symptoms that reflect a crisis of faith or of meaning in life. The third context is the quest for increased well-being and spiritual growth. While a focus on spiritual growth may seem more consistent with traditional spiritual direction, clients today are increasing seeking out psychotherapists rather than ministers and other spiritual guides to foster their spiritual growth and development.

Spiritually oriented psychotherapy is similar but different from pastoral counseling and spiritual direction.
 

Basically, the primary goal of pastoral counseling is spiritual change, while psychological change is a secondary goal. As such, pastoral counseling can also address symptom relief, problem resolution, and the restoration of psychological health. The primary goal of spiritual direction is spiritual change and growth with a focus on prayer. It may also address crisis issues that impact the directee’s spiritual life. Yet its primary emphasis is on developing the directee’s relationship with God. Because prayer is critical to this relationship, the directee’s prayer life is a major consideration. In contrast, the primary goal of spiritually oriented psychotherapy is psychological change and secondary goal is spiritual change or growth. Often, the focus is on the development and maintenance of psychological health and well-being and subsequent spiritual health and well-being.
Spiritually oriented psychotherapy is a broad characterization for a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches that are sensitive to the spiritual dimension. These approaches range from non-Christian approaches, transpersonal psychotherapies, and various Christian approaches. Despite considerable variability among these approaches, some general observations about typical clientele, goals and purposes, the nature of the relationship with the professional, and the type of interventions utilized in spiritually oriented psychotherapy are possible. Individuals seeking spiritually oriented psychotherapy range from relatively healthy spiritual seekers to disordered clients presenting with symptomatic distress and/or impairment in one or more areas of life functioning. The goals of treatment vary according to client presentation and need. They may include help with spiritual emergencies, the process of spiritual growth, increased psychological well-being, self-fulfillment or individuation, or the reduction of symptomatic distress and the restoration of baseline functioning. The therapeutic relationship typically involves mutual collaboration. Not surprisingly, those practicing spiritually oriented psychotherapy presumably will demonstrate respect for the client’s spiritual values and concerns. Various psychotherapeutic and psychospiritual interventions are utilized depending on client need and indication. If indicated, referral for a psychiatric evaluation for medication or hospitalization may occur. Spiritual interventions may also
 


 

be involved. These include spiritual practices, such as prayer and meditation, and, when indicated, collaboration or referral to clergy or chaplain.




“Split brain” refers to the experiments that were conducted by Roger Sperry to learn about the left and right hemispheres of the brain.

The split brain experiments began in an attempt to learn more about the brain as well as to gain a better understanding of epilepsy. In completing this study Dr. Roger Sperry (1913–1994) and his colleagues were able to learn about the differences between the right and left hemispheres of the brain and what happens when they don’t or cannot communicate with each other. Sperry was an American neuropsychologist who earned a Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1981 for his discoveries.
This study led to the realization that the two hemispheres of the brain control different parts of thought as well as action. This meant that the right and left parts of the brain had an area of specialization. The left brain for language and speech and the right for visual-motor tasks. This idea has translated into modern culture where people will casually refer to themselves as being right or left brained based on the areas
 

of interest and skills. For instance, a writer may refer to himself or herself as being left brained as the basis of what he or she does is controlled by the left part of the brain.
The original study provided information about how the halves of the brain communicate to each other and how they do so if separation occurs. This revelation has been helpful in preparing doctors to better understand patients who come in with medical issues such as epilepsy or traumatic brain injury. The study provided information on language, attention, the organization of the brain and consciousness.
The study consisted of 11 participants whose hemispheres had been separated and all had a history of epilepsy. This case study provided in-depth investigations of each of the individuals. Participants were asked to complete tasks and with different tasks part of their vision blocked or covered.
The split brain experiment looked at patients whose hemispheres were already separated. The experiment provided evidence that when the brain had a disconnect it impacted the person on multiple levels. Conflicting demands from each of the hemispheres can have an impact on task completion and communication. However, these separated hemispheres allowed for Sperry and his colleagues to gain an understanding that had not existed previously to how each functioned and what tasks each controlled.
 




Sport psychology is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on psychological factors affecting the performance and well-being of athletes; systemic issues associated with sports settings and organizations; and developmental and social aspects of sports participation.

Definitions
•	Kinesiology is the study of anatomy, physiology, and the mechanics of body movements.
•	Sport sciences include fields such as kinesiology, biomechanics, sport management, sport physiology, sport nutrition, and athletic training.


Sports psychology is a multidisciplinary field of study that focuses on health and exercise psychology, athletic performance psychology, and social psychology. The term “psychology” as applied to sports includes counseling, developmental, clinical, and social psychology. Sports psychology professionals include psychologists, social workers, mental health counselors, and industrial-organizational psychologists.
Health and exercise psychology focuses on psychological factors in sports and exercise related to athletic performance, disease development, and remediation; injury impact and recovery; health promotion; and sports related anxiety and stress. Areas addressed included exercise adherence, impact of exercise on mood and quality of life, and promotion and maintenance of health-enhancing behaviors over the life span. Use of sports and exercise in stress reduction and management as well as cognitive behavioral change strategies in treating performance and physique anxiety, disordered eating, exercise addiction, and movement disorders are also a focus of intervention by sports psychology professionals. Performance psychology focuses on the improvement of athletic performance in competition. Enhancing performance through mental strategies that target overcoming the pressure of competition and managing performance stress related to
 

other’s expectations such as coaches, teammates, and parents are frequently provided services. Social psychology focuses on individual and group dynamics in sport and exercise participation and settings.
Coleman R. Griffith (1893–1966) is credited as the founder of sports psychology in North America. Griffith made numerous contributions to the field and in 1923 taught the first university course in sports psychology. The field expanded due to Griffith’s pioneering work as other researchers began to contribute to the investigation of psychological processes at work in athletic performance. In 1979 the Journal of Sports Psychology became the first published professional journal. In 1986 a group of sports psychologists led by John Silva formed the Association for the Advancement of Applied Sports Psychology, later dropping the word “Advancement” and becoming the Association of Applied Sports Psychology (AASP). The AASP was formed in recognition of the need to emphasize the application of research knowledge to athletes and athletic groups. Also in 1986, members of the American Psychological Association (APA) formed Division 47: Exercise and Sport Psychology.

AASP is an international, multidisciplinary, professional organization with over 1,600 members in 39 countries. It is the largest certification body designating qualified sports psychology professionals as “AASP Certified Consultants.” Only Certified Consultants may use the letters CC-AASP after their names. Certification as a CC-AASP requires membership in AASP, a master’s or doctorate degree with specific course work in sport and exercise psychology, 400 hours of mentored and applied experience, and an extensive evaluation process conducted by the AASP Certification Review Committee. Graduate degrees applicable to CC-AASP status include clinical psychology, educational and mental health counseling, clinical social work, industrial-organizational psychology, and sport and exercise psychology from a sport science field. CC-AASP is the only certification recognized by the United States Olympic Committee. It is important to note that CC-AASP is a credentialing
 


 

process and does not bar individuals without CC-AASP from practicing sports psychology.
Sports psychology is emerging as a distinct profession and has made steady progress over the past two decades. A growing number of professional athletes seek out and acknowledge working with sports psychology professionals, and both amateur and professional trainers are making increasing referrals to sports psychology professionals. In addition, university and high school coaches are increasingly drawing from the growing body of literature and research, which focuses on game preparation, teamwork, and psychological performance enhancement techniques.




St. John’s wort is an herbal remedy used to treat symptoms of depression and various medical conditions.


•	Immunosuppressants are medications that lower the body’s immune system. They are
 

primarily used to help the body accept a transplanted organ.
•	Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are a group of antidepressant drugs that decrease the activity of monoamine oxidase, a neurotransmitter found in the brain that affects mood.
•	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a class of antidepressant medications that work by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin in nerve cells and raising its level in the brain.
•	Serotonin syndrome is a serious medication reaction resulting from an excess of serotonin in the brain. It occurs when medications that increase serotonin are taken together. 


 


 



St. John’s wort is a perennial, yellow-flowering plant and is so named because it blooms about June 24, the birthday of John the Baptist. “Wort” is an old English word for plant. For centuries it has been used as treatment for depression, anxiety, inflammation, injuries, burns, muscle pain, high blood pressure, stomach problems, fluid retention, insomnia, hemorrhoids, and cancer. Research has proven the clinical effectiveness of St. John’s wort in treating mild-to-moderate depression. It also shows promise in treating somatoform disorders, but the research on its treatment of anxiety is conflicting and inconclusive.
Hypericin and hyperforin are two chemicals in St. John’s wort that play a role in relieving depressive symptoms. Both act on chemical messengers in the nervous system that regulate mood. St. John’s wort is believed to work by balancing neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain in much the same way as SSRIs like Paxil and Celexa, and MAOIs like Marplan and Parnate

There are a number of precautions to observe in using St. John’s wort. Depression can be a serious, even life-threatening, condition. For that reason depressed individuals using St. John’s wort must be carefully monitored. It can bring on mania in those with bipolar disorder and can increase cycling between depression and mania. St. John’s wort could worsen symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially in those taking Ritalin. It might trigger psychotic symptoms in some with schizophrenia. St. John’s wort can contribute to dementia in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Pregnant or lactating women should never use it. Nursing infants of mothers who take St. John’s wort can experience colic, drowsiness, and listlessness.
St. John’s wort is generally safe when taken for the short term (three to four months). It can cause some side effects such as anxiety, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, headache, irritability, restlessness, trouble sleeping, vivid dreams, stomach upset, skin rash due to sun
 

sensitivity, and tingling. It appears to be safe when used in children under 12 years of age for less than six weeks. Dangerous interactions can occur when using
St. John’s wort with other antidepressant medicines. Of particular concern is serotonin syndrome. Several cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in those taking St. John’s wort in combination with MAOIs, SSRIs, Pondimin, or Serzone. John’s wort may interfere with the effectiveness of birth control pills, increasing the risk of pregnancy. Also, women taking both birth control pills and St. John’s wort may notice bleeding between menstrual periods. Other medications with reported interactions include amphetamines, asthma inhalants, decongestants, diet pills, narcotics, and the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine. St. John’s wort increases bleeding time in those under general anesthesia. Accordingly, its use should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to major surgery.

Stages of change are sequential periods of time that describe clients’ varying motivation, readiness, and process of engagement in change behaviors.


•	Assimilative integration occurs when one theoretical orientation primarily informs the psychotherapeutic process and techniques of other theories are deliberately adjunctive.
 


 

•	Common factors are the similarities among theories of psychotherapy and the belief that these common factors are the real therapeutic factors.
•	Evidence-based practice is a form of practice that is based on integration of the best research evidence with clinical experience and client values.
•	Motivational interviewing is a form of psychotherapy that aims to enable, engage, and improve on a client’s motivation to change.
•	Psychotherapy is a psychological method for achieving desired changes in thinking, feeling, and behavior. It is also called therapeutic counseling.
•	Self-efficacy is the belief in one’s own abilities.
•	Technical eclecticism is the psychotherapeutic use of intervention techniques from various theories without endorsing the theories themselves.
•	Theoretical integration is the assimilation of two or more theories of psychotherapy.
•	Transtheoretical therapy is an integrative approach to psychotherapy that identifies processes of change, stages of change, and levels of change to tailor treatment to the client.

The stages of change are often conceptualized as a process that occurs over a period of time. Traditionally there are five stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The first stage of change, precontemplation, is marked by the client’s absence of thought about change. After passing through precontemplation a client will enter the contemplation stage of change. In the contemplation stage a client will begin to think about his or her problems and imagine what he or she can do to change. After thinking about change sufficiently in the contemplation stage, a client will progress on to the preparation stage of change. The preparation stage
 

of change is marked by the first attempts to actually change; however, the client still lacks a full commitment to the change process. Next is the action stage of change where clients are serious and committed to their change efforts. Finally, after a client has successfully made the change, he or she will enter the maintenance stage of change. In the maintenance stage of change, a client will strive to preserve therapeutic gains and prevent relapse.
It is important to note that the stages of change model is unique in that it allows psychotherapy to be personalized to the specific stage of change a client is operating from. Further, motivational interviewing is a commonly utilized technique to foster a client’s movement through the stages of change.

The stages of change theory is the most well-developed approach to come out of the eclectic and integrative psychotherapeutic movement that began in the 1930s. The early years of the movement is famously discussed in a paper published by psychologist Saul Rosenzweig (1907–2004) in 1936. It examined the common factors among the diverse theories of psychotherapy. Over the years three other distinct approaches to eclecticism and integrationism were identified and named technical eclecticism, theoretical integration, and assimilative integration. The stages of change model is part of the theoretical integration approach to psychotherapy. It is also part of a larger psychotherapeutic theory called the transtheoretical model introduced by psychologists James Prochaska (1943) and Carlo DiClemente (1940) in 1983. In 2007, the stages of change model was expanded to include two additional stages of change, which are recycling and termination. Recycling alters the linear process of change to incorporate the common occurrence of relapse. When clients do not maintain change, they recycle to an earlier stage of change. “Termination” refers to a stage of client change that is stable enough to remove the threat of relapse. In the stages of change model, termination is the successful resolution of a problem through sufficient change.
 


 



The Stanford Prison Experiment, conducted by psychologists at Stanford University in 1971, demonstrated the influence of situational forces on changing the attitudes, values, and behavior of normal, healthy individuals.

•	The “Lucifer Effect,” a phrase coined by Stanford psychologist Philip Zimbardo, refers to the point in time when an ordinary, good person transforms into an evil one as a result of situational influences.
•	Obedience studies (“Milgram’s Experiments”), led by psychologist Stanley Milgram during the early 1960s, articulated the salience of real or perceived authority at influencing a human being’s thoughts, values, and actions.


In 1971, psychologists at Stanford University conducted an extreme study, now known as the Stanford Prison Experiment, with a volunteer group of college students using a mock prison setting to test the power of social and institutional influence on individual attitudes, values, and behavior. Lead researcher Dr. Philip
 

Zimbardo, a former high school classmate of Stanley Milgram, sought to expand on Milgram’s obedience studies, looking specifically at the impact of institutional factors. The primary question at hand is whether or not normal, healthy, well-functioning individuals would change under stressful, dehumanizing, and hostile circumstances. The results were alarming, causing the experiment to be called off early. Zimbardo summarized the findings in what he called the “Lucifer Effect,” whereby ordinary, good people behave in evil ways if the situation perpetuates it. He wrote about the experiment and his subsequent impressions in the New York Times best seller The Lucifer Effect in 2007.

The Stanford Experiment’s research team included Dr. Zimbardo, Craig Haney, Curtis Banks, David Jaffe, and Carlo Prescott. Some more than 70 college students from the United States and Canada responded to an ad in the newspaper requesting participation in a study on prison life in exchange for $15 a day. Each potential participant was interviewed, subjected to a background check, administered a personality assessment, and examined for physical and mental health. Twenty-four males were selected and randomly assigned to be either guards or prisoners; 9 guards and 9 prisoners (18 total) were actively involved in the study, while the others remained on call if needed. The experiment was planned to last for a one to two-week period. Researchers attempted to simulate a real incarceration setting in the basement of Stanford’s psychology building. This mock prison consisted of three, six-by-nine-foot cells with three cots in each, a room for the guards, an office for the warden (Jaffe), a small room designated as “solitary confinement,” and another small room deemed the prison yard. Prisoners were subjected to commonly experienced circumstances of incarceration: cell confinement, limited privileges, regulated meals, and verbal and physical degradation. They were not permitted to leave the prison at any time. The guards were assigned to three-man teams and required to work eight-hour shifts, but could return home when their shift was over. On day 6 the experiment had to be shut down after a graduate student, Christina Maslauch, raised concerns
 


 

about the behaviors she witnessed among the guards and prisoners. The guards were abusing their power, treating the prisoners in aggressive and dehumanizing ways. The prisoners were affected as well, and either rebelled or retreated, but actively displayed signs of stress, anxiety, and depression. Even the researchers themselves, Zimbardo and Jaffe included, who were videotaping the daily happenings became caught up in the simulation and neglected to stop the injustices. The Stanford Prison Experiment is a poignant example of how situational influences can alter a person’s thoughts, feelings, and actions.

Critics of the study refer to concerns pertaining to generalizability, validity, and researcher bias. Though it would now be in violation of many ethical codes, the Stanford Prison Experiment has added valuable insight into the psychological and sociological study of obedience to authority and to the critical role that power plays in determining one’s sense of control, freedom, and choice. The lessons of this experiment extend to the areas of education, social sciences, human rights, and national defense, and the study’s findings have been applied to situations ranging from bullying among school children to abuse in the military to acts of terrorism. The incidences that occurred at Abu Ghraib Prison during 2003–2004 where Iraqi prisoners were subject to abuses by U.S. Army reservists articulate a recent example of the existence of this phenomenon. Instances such as these have created a national dialogue and spawned research into preventing these types of evils in the future.

Description
The STEP parenting program teaches basic parenting skills such as communication, positive discipline, and boundaries setting. It is a seven-session course that teaches parents about dealing with conflict in the family and also enhancing communication. STEP is based on Adlerian psychology. The program is facilitated by
 


 

a designated facilitator and also includes reading materials and a parent survey. The seven sessions cover the following topics:

Understanding Yourself and Your Child
Understanding Beliefs and Feelings
Encouraging Your Child and Yourself
Listening and Talking to Your Child
Helping Children Learn to Cooperate
Discipline That Makes Sense
Choosing Your Approach

The program includes the following methods of
 



Stereotypic Movement Disorder
 
instruction and learning: role plays, group discussions,		
analyzing videos, analysis of challenging situations,
 
and homework. Some of the skills and content that are covered include reflective listening, using I-messages, utilizing family meeting, exploring alternatives for solving problems, using natural and creating logical consequences of an action, showing respect, and identifying the four goals of misbehavior. The four goals of misbehavior include power, revenge, assumed inadequacy, and attention seeking. There are four versions of the STEP program available: Early Childhood STEP for parents of children up to age 6; STEP for parents of children ages 6 to 12; STEP/Teen for parents of teens; and Spanish STEP, which is a complete translation of the STEP program for parents of children ages 6 to 12.

Developments and Current Status
This program was created by Adlerian psychology practitioners and authors: Don Dinkmeyer, Sr. (1924–2001), Gary D. McKay, and Don Dinkmeyer, Jr. STEP has been taught to over 4 million parents and has been translated into Japanese, French, Korean, Chinese, German, and Spanish. The STEP program is still utilized today throughout the world and is considered an evidenced-based program.

Description and Diagnosis
Stereotypic movement disorder is one of the DSM-5 neurodevelopmental disorders. It is characterized by repeated, rhythmic, and purposeless movements of the body. These may be harmless or cause harm (self-injury) to the individual. Examples of harmless behaviors include body rocking, hand waving, and head nodding. Harmful behaviors include head banging, face slapping, eye poking, and biting. Individuals typically develop a specific pattern of these movements. Movements may occur multiple times per day or there may be weeks in between episodes. They may occur generally or in specific situations, such as when individuals are under stress, bored, or excited. There are simple and complex stereotypic movements. Simple stereotypic movements are common during childhood development. These movements begin in the first year of life and generally disappear by age three. For example, infants often make repetitive sucking motions. This serves the purpose of getting food and developing motor skills. These types of movements are not considered harmful or purposeless and are not evidence of stereotypic movement disorder.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit repetitive and purposeless movements. The movements must cause harm or interfere with individuals’ daily lives, such as in school, work, and social interactions. There must not be any other direct cause for the movements, such as the effects of substances like stimulants. Symptoms must also appear during early childhood development (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Stereotypic movement disorder is different from other mental disorders that involve repetitive movement, like obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette’s syndrome. These disorders occur later in development.
 

The exact causes of this disorder are unknown. It is believed that inadequate caregiving or social isolation during childhood can lead to these movements. This may be because movement relieves anxiety or produces self-soothing (activities that comfort and nurture). Stereotypic movement disorder is common in individuals who are institutionalized. Another possible explanation is the presence of other neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder. Movements may indicate underlying medical conditions such as infection and seizures.

Treatment
There is no cure for stereotypic movement disorder. Treatment usually focuses on decreasing harmful behaviors. This may involve behavior therapy and antipsychotic medications. In extreme cases, individuals are physically restrained to keep them from harming themselves. Occasionally, movements may disappear naturally as individuals age. Others may experience them throughout life. Currently, there is no way to prevent the development of this disorder.


Stigma

Stigma is a negative judgment made by an individual or group, which results in isolation or rejection of the persons being judged.
 


 

Description
Being excluded from a desirable social group is something that almost everyone experiences during the course of his or her life. From a therapeutic or psychological point of view, social stigma is of interest because of the extreme or lasting negative impact that rejection, exclusion, and marginalization can have on individuals. Stigma occurs among a variety of individuals and groups whose beliefs or lifestyles do not fit the norm. This can be based on ethnicity, religion, race, or other demographic factors. Stigma is often associated with those who suffer from mental illness. Stigma is usually applied because those with mental disorders may exhibit behaviors or characteristics that are found morally or socially unacceptable by the majority.
In the 1890s social scientists began to deal with the negative effect that the reactions of others can have on the excluded person’s sense of identity. It was Canadian sociologist Erving Goffman’s book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity that brought this issue to international public awareness. Since that time many psychologists have explored the effects of social stigmatization on individual identity, subgroups, and those with mental health issues.
Stigma and shame are very closely connected because being judged negatively results in feelings of rejection, unworthiness, and embarrassment. This in turn leads some stigmatized people to try to hide their identity, known as concealment. Their values and feelings are often hidden from others. Concealment can be applied to someone’s background, experience, or culture. It is damaging when people are forced to disguise themselves because they fear rejection or even physical and psychological personal threats. Stigmatization has demonstrated negative effects on one’s self-esteem, academic achievement, and general health.
For many societies and cultures, mental illness is a stigma that means automatic rejection from others. This includes placing people into categories such as crazy or deranged. Society has a tendency to label those who suffer from more severe conditions as potentially dangerous. This kind of stereotyping can place added pressure on individuals with mental disorders who are already suffering from identity and inclusion issues. In some cases, the results of stigmatization can
 

cause additional life stressors that challenge their already poor coping skills.

Current Status and Impact (Psychological Influence)
Although social norms and standards are constantly changing, counselors need to be aware that clients may not immediately be able to identify the effects of stigma in their life. Such diverse factors as ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status may lead to stigmas that affect clients psychologically. Clients may present with depression or other issues related to their self-identity. It is important for counselors to consider the issue of stigmatization for each client. The very event of seeking help or getting counseling can be a stigmatizing process itself. Most therapists can be trained on the different ways that the effects of stigma are expressed.
It is important for health-care professionals to be able to recognize the impact of stigma and its causative role in mental health and psychological problems. This is key to developing successful strategies for intervention. These interventions may take various forms from identifying and targeting stigma or stress-related health problems to helping the client decrease his or her vulnerability to being stereotyped. A focus on strengthening resilience for individuals so that they can overcome issues surrounding stigma is one effective tool. Not all the issues connected with stigmatization can be handled in clinical therapeutic settings. Many stigmatized issues require social action and political change.
The concept of stigma has been criticized for being too vague and overly focused on the individual. Nevertheless, the fact that individuals and groups are rejected and isolated socially or politically is a reality. This is especially true for those who have been diagnosed with and treated for mental health issues. Being diagnosed with a mental disorder can have negative effects on a person’s life, including lower salaries, less access to housing, the potential for criminal involvement, and vulnerabilities to physical health problems. Many argue that the stigma associated with mental disorders puts people at a clear disadvantage and can negatively impact their prognosis and quality of life.
 


 


Stimulant Use Disorder

Stimulant use disorder is a mental disorder that is characterized by the use of stimulants leading to significant problems for the user. It includes stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine, but not caffeine or nicotine.

Definitions
•	Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain, which involves compulsive and uncontrolled pursuit of reward or relief with substance use or other compulsive behaviors.
•	Benzodiazepines are a class of medications that slow the nervous system and are prescribed to relieve nervousness and tension, to induce sleep, and to treat other symptoms. They can be highly addictive.
•	Cognitive behavior therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on maladaptive (problematic) behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. It is also called CBT.
•	Detoxification is a medical treatment for drug addiction that removes the physiological effects of the addictive substance and withdrawal from it.
•	Dopamine is the chemical messenger in the brain responsible for coordinating the movement of voluntary muscle groups. It also regulates attention, pleasure, and coping with stress.
 

•	Stimulant is a drug that increases brain activity and produces a sense of alertness, euphoria, endurance, and productivity, or suppresses appetite. Examples are cocaine, amphetamines, and Ritalin.
•	Substance-related and addictive disorders are a group of mental disorders that include substance disorders characterized by physiological dependence, drug-seeking behavior, tolerance, and social withdrawal. This group also includes the non-substance disorder of gambling.


Description and Diagnosis
Stimulant use disorder is one of the substance-related and addictive disorders. It is characterized by a pattern of stimulant use that results in significant distress or disrupted functioning within a period of 12 months. This disorder includes amphetamine, cocaine, MDMA, ecstasy, and other stimulants but not caffeine or nicotine. Stimulants cause a buildup of dopamine in the brain, which leads to its many effects including intense pleasure and increased energy. The most often abused stimulants are of two types: amphetamine-like stimulants and cocaine. It is estimated that approximately 0.2% of the adult population are addicted to amphetamine-type stimulants and 0.3% are addicted to cocaine (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Amphetamines produce feelings of euphoria, provide relief from fatigue, increase mental alertness, and enhance mood. Negative short-term side effects include anxiety, confusion, paranoia, and aggression. Chronic use can result in side effects such as depression, psychotic behavior, and hallucinations. It can also lead to respiratory problems, cardiovascular problems, and extreme weight loss. Other dangers include infectious disease (due to shared needle use), intense cravings, and extremely poor oral hygiene. Cocaine produces feelings of profound well-being, enhanced alertness, and increased energy and strength. It also increases self-confidence, sexual drive, and a sense of mastery and power, while decreasing anxiety. Dangers include severe cardiovascular problems, irritability, nervousness, and agitation. Its long-term use leads to fewer dopamine (brain
 


 

chemical) receptors. That results in decreased ability to experience pleasure as well as nasal cavity irritation, problems swallowing, and lung damage.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, individuals can be diagnosed with this disorder if they exhibit a problematic pattern of cannabis use, leading to significant impairment or distress. This must occur within a 12-month period. This includes taking the substance in larger amounts or for longer than intended. It means wanting to cut down or stop using the substance but not achieving this goal. It involves spending much time getting, using, or recovering from use of the substance. This disorder also involves cravings and urges to use the substance, and continuing to use, even when it causes problems in relationships. It involves failure to meet obligations at home, work, or school because of substance use. It also means reducing or stopping important social, work, or recreational activities because of substance use. This disorder involves repeated substance use even when it is physically dangerous. Despite knowing the risks of the physical and psychological problem that are caused or made worse by the substance, use of it continues. It means develop tolerance (needing more of it to get the desired effect). Finally, it involves withdrawal symptoms, which can be relieved by taking more of the substance (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Adolescents and adults use and abuse stimulants
for various reasons. These include feeling good, getting high, relaxing, or relieving tension. Other reasons include reducing appetite and increasing alertness, and preventing withdrawal symptoms. These drugs are also used to be accepted by peers (amid peer pressure) or to be more social. Finally, they are used to improve concentration and work or academic performance. These drugs are also used by those with bipolar disorder. From a psychological perspective, stimulant use can also serve specific purposes. For instance, cocaine can be used to feel strong and empowered, while cocaine provides relief from discouragement.

Treatment
Treatment of this disorder usually requires detoxification and counseling or psychotherapy. Because withdrawal can be dangerous, detoxification should be done
 

under medical supervision. This treatment involves tapering off the medication and relieving withdrawal symptoms, which typically includes sleep, appetite, and mood disturbances. Cognitive behavior therapy may be used to identify the beliefs, behaviors, and situations that trigger stimulant use and cravings. Therapy then focuses on developing a plan to reduce the likelihood of relapse. This may include a Twelve-Step Program. Other treatments may also be needed, particularly if depressant drugs (alcohol or barbiturates) were used to reduce anxiety and promote sleep. Detoxification will be needed for these substances. Treatment for stimulant addiction is often longer in duration when it causes depression or another mental disorder. Accordingly, these other disorders must be treated simultaneously. Finally, unlike marijuana and opiate drugs, the craving for stimulant drugs is much more intense and extended.

Stimulant-Related Disorders

Stimulant-related disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant distress and disruption of daily life caused by the use of stimulants.

Twelve-Step Programs are self-help groups whose members attempt recovery from various addictions based on a plan called the Twelve Steps.

Description and Diagnosis
Stimulant-related disorders are a group of DSM-5 mental disorders characterized by significant psychological and physical distress and impaired daily functioning caused by the use of stimulants. This group of disorders is one of the 10 classes of disorders known as the substance-related and addictive disorders in DSM-5. Because stimulants are energizing, they may be prescribed to reduce sleepiness, decrease appetite, and reduce restlessness. They are also used to treat conditions such as narcolepsy, depression, and attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder. Some examples of legal stimulants include caffeine, nicotine, and prescription medications (e.g., amphetamines). Individuals also use stimulants for recreational use and abuse. They are often abused for the intense excitement that accompanies them. Some examples of illegal stimulants include ecstasy, cocaine, and meth-amphetamine. Illegal stimulants are extremely addictive. They cause mind racing and rapid heartbeat, and have the potential for overdose and death. Whether or not a stimulant is legal or illegal, they all may eventually lead to addiction.
There are five separate classifications of mental health diagnoses that fall under the category of stimulant-related disorders. They include stimulant use disorder, stimulant intoxication, stimulant
 


 

withdrawal, other stimulant-induced disorders, and unspecified stimulant-related disorder. Following are brief descriptions of each of these disorders. Stimulant use disorder is more fully described in its own entry in this encyclopedia.
Stimulant use disorder. Stimulant use disorder is a
mental health disorder characterized by problems associated with the use of amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, or other stimulant drugs. Individuals with this disorder often lead to having significant distress or impairment as a result of taking larger amounts of a stimulant or over a longer period than intended. Individuals have a strong urge to use a stimulant and spend a great deal of time trying to acquire, use, and recover from the stimulant. Those with this disorder fail to fulfill obligations at home, work, or school. Stimulant use disorders lead to persistent or recurrent interpersonal and social problems, and important activities in one’s life are reduced or given up as a result of continued use. Individuals continually use stimulants despite physical and psychological problems. Individuals who use amphetamine-type stimulants or cocaine can develop this disorder within one week. Tolerance of this disorder will occur with repeated use regardless of how the stimulant is administered (e.g., orally, injection, smoking, or snorting). One who has developed tolerance to a stimulant will need an increased amount of the drug in order to achieve the desired effect. Withdrawal symptoms can occur after an individual stops using or reduces the amount of a stimulant. They include excessive daytime sleepiness, increased appetite, depression, suicidal thoughts, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Aggressive and violent behavior is common when large doses of a stimulant are smoked, ingested, or administered intravenously. Furthermore, those who use high doses of stimulants may experience extreme anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, and psychosis.
Stimulant intoxication. Stimulant intoxication is a
mental health disorder characterized by the presence of significant behavioral or psychological changes that begin during or shortly after the use of cocaine, an amphetamine-type substance, or other stimulant. Some of the behavioral and psychological changes include excitability, impaired judgment, anxiety, and anger. Hallucinations and paranoia may also be
 

present. Stimulant intoxication usually begins with a high feeling and includes some of the following symptoms. They include hyperactivity, restlessness, talkativeness, alertness, grandiosity, and poor judgment. Signs and symptoms accompany these behavioral and psychological symptoms shortly after stimulant use. They include rapid heartbeat, pupil dilation, chills or perspiration, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, chest pain, seizures, or coma. Stimulant intoxication can either be acute or chronic and is associated with impaired social or occupational functioning. Severe stimulant intoxication can result in death.
Stimulant withdrawal. Stimulant withdrawal is a
mental health disorder characterized by withdrawal symptoms that usually develop within a few hours to several days after complete discontinuation or reduction of prolonged amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant use. The development of a distressed mood is an element of withdrawal, along with several other symptoms, which includes lack of energy, lack of sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness, increased appetite, unpleasant dreams, and agitation. A slower than normal heart rate is often present with the withdrawal of stimulants. Individuals experience significant impairment and distress in occupational, social, and other important areas of one’s life. The signs and symptoms of stimulant withdrawal cannot be attributed to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder.
Other stimulant-induced disorders. Other stimulant-induced disorders, which include amphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulant disorders, are described in other chapters of the DSM-5 with disorders with which they share occurrences. Some examples of shared occurrences include stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, stimulant-induced anxiety disorder, and stimulant-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder. These stimulant-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of stimulate intoxication or stimulant withdrawal only when the symptoms are severe enough to justify independent clinical attention.
Unspecified stimulant-related disorder. Unspecified stimulant-related disorder is a category that is applied to the presentation of symptoms that are characteristic of a stimulant-related disorder. The one symptom that clearly occurs in this disorder is the
 


 

significant impairment and distress in an individual’s occupational, social, or other areas of important functioning. The full criteria needed to make the diagnosis of a specific stimulant-related disorder are not met. Therefore, this is the diagnosis given.

Treatment
The clinical treatment of these disorders varies depending on the disorder. Generally, treatment involves a combination of participating in an inpatient treatment program, complete abstinence from any mind-altering substances, psychotherapy, attending Twelve-Step Programs, obtaining a sponsor, working the Twelve Steps of recovery, and medication management.



Stockholm Syndrome

Stockholm syndrome is a mental disorder characterized by an individual having positive feelings or sympathy toward his or her captor or abuser.

Definitions
•	Defense mechanisms are strategies for self-protection against anxiety and other negative emotions that accompany stress.
 

•	DSM-5 stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which is a diagnostic system used by professionals to identify mental disorders with specific diagnostic criteria.

Description
Stockholm syndrome is an uncommon mental disorder whereby an individual who has been exposed to severe stress by an abusive individual who feels positively or sympathetically toward that individual. The most common activities associated with the manifestation of this disorder are kidnapping, hostage situations, domestic or other abuse, prisoners of war, and cults. The occurrence rate of this disorder is not known because such situations occur rarely. Although this disorder is recognized, it is not induced in DSM-5 because it lacks sufficient research support.
The explanation given for the behavior of those exhibiting this disorder is the false sense of gratitude felt by those whose lives are acutely threatened but then spared. Another explanation is that it occurs as a defense mechanism or survival strategy. In the case of defense mechanism, the disorder may occur in response to the unbearable stress created by the life-threatening circumstance of the victim. Similarly, if the disorder is a strategy for survival, individuals are believed to act and feel positively toward their captor in the hopes that they will be sparred. The bonding that occurs between victim and captor occurs in a very short period of time.
This disorder was named after an extended bank robbery that took place in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1973. Hostages were taken and held captive for several days but began to support their captors and even defended them after the hostages were released. A similar situation occurred when Patricia Hearst, then a 19-year-old heiress of the Hearst publishing fortune, was kidnapped and held hostage in 1974 by a revolutionary group called the Symbionese Liberation Army. She participated in a bank robbery with them. Even months after her release, Ms. Hearst actively supported her captors, although she later condemned them for their treatment of her. This syndrome was also noted among some hostages in the 1985 hijacking of TWA
 


 


Strategic Family Therapy

Strategic family therapy involves the whole family unit in a brief therapeutic intervention designed to
 

bring about rapid change. The therapist plays the leading role, with the family members completing various tasks to shift their systems of interaction toward the contracted outcome.

Description
Strategic family therapy is a form of brief therapy that involves the entire family unit. It was developed in California in the 1950s, rising to therapeutic prominence over the next several decades through the work of Gregory Bateson, Don Jackson, Jay Haley, Salvador Minuchin, Cloe Madanes, and Milton Erickson, among others. Though its popularity has waxed and waned in the subsequent years, strategic family therapy has been found to be a scientifically effective model appropriate for use with families from all cultures and ethnicities.
During strategic family therapy, the therapist takes a leading role. The goal of therapy is to address a specific issue or change a specific behavior pattern. It is not introspective, and the examination of the reasons behind an issue is given less emphasis than action to change the issue. Toward that end, the therapist may assign tasks to family members in session or give homework to the group to complete between sessions. The therapy is deemed successful when the targeted behavior or issue has been addressed or improved to the satisfaction of the family group.
Strategic family therapy aims to change family patterns of interaction in order to achieve a specific outcome. This might mean improved marital relations, a cessation of domestic violence, better school performance, or even a drug habit intervention. The overarching goal is the change in exhibited behaviors, and as such, introspection and understanding the roots of the problem are given less of a role in therapy sessions. It is not that the past is wholly irrelevant; it is simply that here, present and future outcomes have the leading role. Designed as a brief therapy, strategic family therapy enrollment is typically triggered by a social services referral or specific event tipping point, such as an arrest, school suspension, or “last straw” moment from within the family. It begins with an evaluative assessment where group members meet with the therapist (individually or jointly, depending on the case) to discuss desired outcomes prior to beginning therapy.
 


 

While there may be multiple issues at place, the subsequent strategic therapy sessions will focus only on the contracted issue or change goals and not move beyond the immediate problem unless the family specifically requests this expansion.
The family attends sessions as a group, though the therapist may meet with individual family members separately in addition to the group sessions as needed. During the therapy sessions, the therapist takes a leading role and plays the part of interventionist. Role-playing, tests/ordeals, directives, and take-home assignments may all be used to try and shift family behavior patterns. Thus, the therapist must balance both a role as a trusted helper and a role as an antagonist challenging the existing system when leading the family through the sessions. Therapy ends when the contracted outcomes are reached, though some clients may transition to other forms of ongoing individual or family therapy.

Development and Current Status
Strategic family therapy grew from Bateson’s cybernetics model. The first major institute championing its research and use was the Palo Alto Mental Research Institute, founded in 1958 by Jackson. Erickson, Haley, Madanes, and Minuchin, along with Virginia Satir, Richard Fisch, R. D. Laing, and Irvin Yalom, spent significant time there over the next decade developing aspects of the therapy and enshrining it as a key part of the marriage and family therapy canon.
However, the active, interventionist role played by the therapist in strategic family therapy became a source of tension as the different researchers theorized about different sources for family imbalance. Erickson, Bateson, and Jackson focused on systems and feedback loops, while Haley and Madanes focused more on power imbalances, believing shifts in hierarchical structures could both cause and repair family dysfunction. Difference in practice approaches led Haley to leave the institute, though he continued to be a major influencer in the strategic family therapy movement.
The interventionist model attracted additional negative attention in late 1970s and 1980s. At that time, shifting views on the appropriate roles for therapists in patient behavior change led some strategic family therapy practices—such as assigned tests or intentional
 

deceptions to bring about change to be accused of being manipulative by the broader psychological community. This led to a sharp decline in research and study in the strategic family therapy space, though it was still widely practiced.
Since 2000, there has been a resurgence in research and study, especially as long-term studies and field teams have continued to report on the effectiveness of strategic family therapy “in the trenches,” particularly for treating complex cases. Emerging data in the dynamic systems field has justified many of the more controversial and “manipulative” practices of strategic family therapists, proving that these hands-on directives are in fact grounded in sound science within the context of treating complex systems, including families. Cross-cultural studies from the late 1990s and early 2000s have also shown that the short, action-oriented sessions can be extremely effective in treating families from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds, especially as they seek to adapt to new environments.
Currently, the Mental Research Institute has regained its status as an active trainer and leader in the field of strategic family therapy. The therapy is increasingly popular in complex social services settings, particularly for dealing with adolescents. In that context, the therapy has proven to be effective both at changing behaviors in families with troubled adolescents and in containing costs of treatment where multiple agencies (schools, social welfare groups, and the legal system) are involved. As a result, strategic family therapy is likely to maintain a steady presence in the marriage and family therapy world for the foreseeable future.


Strattera (Atomoxetine)

Strattera is a prescription medication used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Its generic name is atomoxetine.

Definitions
•	Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a mental condition characterized by a lack of concentration, impulsive or inappropriate behavior, and hyperactivity.
•	Dopamine is a chemical messenger in the brain that transmits nerve impulses that regulate attention, concentration, emotion, movement, impulse control, and judgment.
•	Neurotransmitters are a group of chemical messengers in the brain that message to other nerve cells. Common neurotransmitters include acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.
•	Norepinephrine is a chemical messenger in the brain that serves to transmit nerve impulses that regulate attention and power the “fight or flight” stress response. As such, it causes constriction of blood vessels. It is also called noradrenaline.
•	Selective serotonin norepinephrine reup-take inhibitors (SNRI) are antidepressant medications that act on and increase the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain that influences mood. They differ from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which act only on serotonin.

Description
Strattera belongs to a class of non-stimulating medications known as a selective norepinephrine reuptake
 

inhibitors (SNRIs). It is used to treat children and adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Unlike ADHD medications like Ritalin, Strattera is not likely to be abused. Also, because it is not a controlled substance, the rules for prescribing it are much less strict. Strattera was the first non-stimulant medication approved for the treatment of ADHD. It is commonly used for those who develop multiple side effects from stimulants or who cannot tolerate stimulants because of coexisting anxiety or substance abuse. Since stimulants can worsen tics in those with Tourette’s syndrome and ADHD, Strattera is particularly useful because it can treat ADHD without worsening coexisting tics. For those with ADHD and coexisting depression, Strattera is useful since it also has antidepressant properties. It is believed that a decrease in norepinephrine in the brain contributes to disorders such as ADHD and depression. As an SNRI, Strattera is thought to work by increasing levels of norepinephrine, while also regulating dopamine in certain brain areas.

Precautions and Side Effects
Strattera must be used with caution in those with un-controlled hypertension, liver or kidney function impairment, glaucoma, heart conditions, and seizure disorder. Strattera must be used with care in those with bipolar disorder since it can trigger mania. Care should be taken to weigh the risks and benefits of Strattera in women who are or wish to become pregnant, as well as in breast-feeding mothers.
Common side effects include dry mouth, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, constipation, insomnia, vivid dreams, decreased appetite, erectile dysfunction, drowsiness, numbness and tingling in the extremities, dizziness, fatigue, hot flashes, increased blood pressure and heart rate, sweating, and palpitations. Rare but serious reactions include very high blood pressure, glaucoma, loss of consciousness, heart arrhythmias, heart attack, stroke, seizures, liver toxicity, and sudden death. Some develop increased aggressiveness, psychosis, mania, or suicidality in the first weeks of use. Children are especially at risk for these behavioral side effects. When starting treatment or after dose changes, those taking Strattera need to be monitored closely for behavioral changes.
 


 

Medications that may cause toxicity with Strattera include antidepressants such as Wellbutrin and Cymbalta; the antiulcer medication cimetidine; caffeine; and antipsychotics like Haldol and Mellaril. It is unknown which herbal supplements interact with Strattera. Since monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) increase norepinephrine and dopamine, they cannot be used concurrently with Strattera. Switching treatment from an MAOI to Strattera may require a waiting period of up to two weeks. Ludiomil (an antidepressant) may also have additive effects with Strattera that cause toxicity.


Stress

Stress is the psychological, emotional, and physical state of strain resulting from negative appraisals of events, situations, and circumstances.

Definitions
•	Cognitive appraisals are what a person thinks, believes, and concludes about events, situations, and circumstances.
•	Insomnia is an inability to get to sleep or remain asleep during normal sleep times.

Description
Stress is the physical, emotional, and behavioral reactions to adverse events, situations, and circumstances.
 

Stress can be acute or chronic. Acute stress is the most common and is short term in nature. Acute stress can result in emotional upset with some temporary physical manifestations such as headache or upset stomach. Not all acute stress is negative, such as the stress associated with riding a roller-coaster. Acute stress also has some positive effects as when it motivates people toward positive action. For instance, when an exam or deadline is in the near future, stress contributes to motivating a person to study or prepare. In extreme circumstances an automatic response to acute stress is a “fight or flight” reaction that serves to protect or defend an individual.
Physical symptoms of acute stress can include an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, dry mouth, stomach upset, and muscle tightening. Emotional reactions can include feelings of anxiety, anger, panic, and fear. Stress-related behaviors can include disturbed sleep patterns, overeating or undereating, social isolation, irritability, increased use of alcohol and drugs, or developing nervous habits such as nail biting or pacing back and forth.
Stress has been highly studied. Perhaps the best-known research on stress and coping was led by American psychologist Richard Lazarus (1922–2002). Lazarus and colleagues proposed that stress is an interaction between how individuals appraise, or assess, situations and its impact on their well-being. Individuals assess and categorize stressful events through primary and secondary cognitive appraisals. Primary appraisals evaluate the impact of an event or situation on one’s life and well-being. Secondary appraisals evaluate what can be done to manage or cope with the event or circumstances. Secondary appraisals of coping options and primary appraisals of what is at stake interact with each other in shaping the degree of stress and the nature of the emotional reaction. For instance, a college student is assigned to a group project that will be worth half of her overall grade for the class. Her primary appraisal is that she could fail the class if her teammates perform poorly on the assignment. Her secondary appraisal is that she has no control over the assignment. This primary appraisal “I could fail” and the secondary appraisal “I have no control” result in a high level of stress and she becomes anxious and unable to sleep. Substitute
 


 

her secondary appraisal with the thought “I am pretty good at motivating people and working with a team” and the level of stress would be much less. Cognitive appraisals are very powerful in the formation and management of stress.
Prolonged or chronic stress has been shown to have many adverse physical effects on the body. Because stress can raise blood pressure, chronic stress can lead to heart attack and stroke. Chronic stress can manifest in specific areas of the body such as the head or stomach resulting in migraine headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, or ulcers, to name a few. Chronic stress can also lead to emotional debilitation through depression or anxiety disorders. Both acute and chronic stress can impact the immune system making people more vulnerable to illness.
Individual levels of hardiness and resiliency have a direct impact on perceived stress. Hardiness is the ability to withstand or tolerate stress, and resiliency is the ability to recover from stressful events. People who are hardy and resilient are able to cope with stressful events more effectively and with less emotional upset than are those who are less hardy and resilient. There are some events so stressful that they overwhelm a person’s ability to recover. People who have experienced or witnessed life-threatening and horrific situations sometimes develop post-traumatic stress disorder and need the help of a mental health professional in order to recover.
Treatment for people who suffer from chronic stress, or are vulnerable to stress, is generally referred to as stress management. Stress management refers to a wide spectrum of treatments and includes exercise programs, self-relaxations techniques, biofeedback, guided imagery, meditation, and psychotherapy. The most common stressors are work, marital, and family related. Because stress is so common, there are a multitude of books, techniques, and seminars aimed at teaching people how to reduce and cope with stress. Most stress-related psychotherapies are cognitively oriented. The most common psychotherapy for addressing stress-related difficulties is cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT focuses on changing and modifying an individual’s primary and secondary cognitive appraisals in order to strengthen coping skills.
 



Stress Management

“Stress management” refers to a wide variety of techniques and methods used to reduce and manage acute and chronic stress.

Definitions
Acute stress is the most common form of stress, is short term, and results in minor and temporary emotional and physical upset.
Chronic stress is long-term stress that is emotionally and physically harmful to the health and well-being of the individual.
Cognitive appraisals are what a person thinks, believes, and concludes about events, situations, and circumstances.
Stress is the psychological, emotional, and physical state of strain resulting from negative appraisals of events, situations, and circumstances.

Description
Stress management refers to a wide variety of techniques used to assist individuals in reducing and managing stress. Stress occurs when situations are perceived as more demanding than a person’s ability or resources to cope with the demands. Stress is the interaction between how individuals appraise, or assess, situations
 


 

and its impact on their well-being. Chronic stress has been found to have extremely negative health consequences, including hypertension and developing cardiovascular disease, obesity through emotional eating, and increased risk for heart attack and stroke, as well as developing chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, anxiety, and other mental health difficulties.
Because of the severity of stress impact on individual well-being, a multitude of preventative and stress management interventions have been developed. Stress management techniques are not only therapeutic but can also prevent the development of stress-related disorders. Evidence-based stress management methods include relaxation and breathing techniques, imaginal processing and mindfulness techniques, and cognitive-based techniques.
Muscle relaxation and breathing techniques are strategies that help clients attend to physical sensations in order to achieve periods of physical and mental relaxation. Muscle relaxation includes both a physical and a mental component. The physical component includes the sequential tightening and relaxing of muscles in the legs, abdomen, chest, arms, and face. Therapists instruct clients to tense muscle groups for 10 seconds and then relax the muscle group for 20 seconds before moving to the next group of muscles. Clients are instructed to practice the technique multiple times a day for short periods of time in order to produce a relaxed and peaceful physical and mental state. While tensing and relaxing the client concentrates on the difference between the tension and relaxation and learns to more quickly dissipate the physical symptoms of stress. Concentrating on muscles assists clients to block the cognitive processes associated with stress production. Outcome studies indicate that relaxation techniques help decrease blood pressure and heart rate, decrease headaches, and decrease levels of anxiety. Concentrating on deep breathing has long been used to produce states of relaxation. Diaphragmatic slow breathing in which individuals breathe from the diaphragm in the abdomen has been successfully used to decrease fatigue, reduce anxiety, manage aggressive behaviors, and reduce signs and symptoms of various health difficulties such as asthma.
Biofeedback is a technique in which individuals learn to control certain body functions by using electrical sensors and instruments to measure brain-waves, heart function, breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature. The sensors provide instant feedback of body responses to changes in a person’s thinking, emotions, and behaviors during biofeedback sessions. Trained therapists provide biofeedback training, and in three to six months an individual can learn to control functions such as heart rate and blood pressure. Biofeedback has been successfully used to reduce anxiety, blood pressure, headache, and other medical difficulties.
Stress management techniques include the use of guided imagery, meditation, and mindfulness techniques. Guided imagery is a method that focuses and directs the imagination in ways that are symbolic of a client’s health and life issues. Therapists facilitate the development of personalized images and have clients create a script to follow that promotes relaxation and stress reduction. Engaging daily in these guided imaginal scripts have been found to reduce stress and promote health. Meditation in various forms has been found to be effective in reducing stress. Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years and involves focusing one’s attention on a single activity such as a mantra. A mantra, as used in transcendental meditation, is a series of meaningless sequence of sounds and provides an activity that requires a person to disregard all other distractions such as thoughts and memories of stressful daily events. Other foci of attention may be body sensations, ambient sounds, images, and so on. Mindfulness is a type of meditation that focuses attention on moment-to-moment body awareness, and bringing one’s complete attention to the present experience, thought, emotion, and sensation, but from a nonjudgmental distance. The goal is to assist clients learn to regulate emotions by awareness and reflection in a meditative state.


Research on suicide has compared the brains of suicide victims to those of “normal” people. Findings indicate that there are key differences in specific cells called astrocytes contained within the brain’s white matter. As suicide has been strongly linked to depression, scientists have noted that those with a history of depression have larger and more branched networks of astrocytes than those with no history of mental illness. Further studies have linked suicidal behavior with abnormalities in serotonin receptor subtypes located in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and choroid plexus. Twin studies have also confirmed these neurological distinctions. Additional studies have associated suicidal behavior with traumatic life events, including sexual abuse and bullying.
 


 

Each year approximately 39,000 people commit suicide in the United States alone and about 1 million adults report making a suicide attempt. A recent report from the World Health Organization indicates that suicide is a global health problem. It is the 10th leading cause of death for Americans overall and the second leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 29. Prevention efforts have focused on increasing understanding and education surrounding the causes and consequences of suicide and also on promoting support and intervention to those demonstrating warning signs, suicidal thoughts, or attempts. Evidence-based prevention programs that work to enhance protective factors and resilience have proven successful.


Suicide assessment involves the process in which a qualified professional evaluates and determines a patient’s level of risk for suicide through the use of screening tools, questionnaires, observation forms, checklists, and review health and medical history.

•	Suicidal ideation is the clinical term used to describe when an individual has preoccupied or persistent thoughts about suicide.
 

•	Suicide is the intentional or unintentional act of taking one’s own life.

Assessing an individual’s risk and taking the proper steps to provide intervention, treatment, and support is critical in reducing suicide incidence rates. Suicide assessment, also referred to as suicide risk assessment, is a complex process that involves the use of screening tools, observation forms, checklists, and questionnaires designed to gauge an individual’s likelihood of suicidal behavior in the near future. Assessments such as these are conducted by properly qualified practitioners, usually mental health-care providers. Research has identified certain predictors strongly associated with suicide risk: demographics, existence of psychiatric and/or medical illness, and significant life stressors. In addition to these key areas, a comprehensive suicide assessment also examines prior suicide attempts, plan and means, presenting symptomatology, and protective factors. Acute (recent changes in circumstances and mental state) and chronic (diagnosed mental illness, social and demographic factors) patient risk are assessed on a continuum ranging from nonexistent to extreme. Several warning signs of suicidality exist: threatening to hurt/kill oneself, seeking out means to kill oneself, and talking, writing about death, dying, or suicide; displaying feelings of anger, despair, revenge, and/or hopelessness; engaging in risky behaviors; withdrawing from friends and family; excessive sleeping; and drastic mood swings. The more detailed and specified an individual’s suicide
 


 

plan, the more likely he or she is to carry it out. The existence of a suicide note also increases one’s probability. After assessing patients in threat of suicide, practitioners may recommend voluntary/involuntary hospitalization or outpatient treatment consisting of medication, behavioral intervention, and/or counseling support.


Though informal means for gauging suicidality have existed for centuries, more formal tools were developed in the later part of the 20th century. Psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck released the Suicide Intent Scale in 1974, a questionnaire designed to measure aspects related to suicidal attempts and intent. In 1979, Beck went on to create the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) with colleagues Maria Kovacs and Arlene Weissman, to assist practitioners in determining the intensity of suicidal thoughts in patients. A popular self-report measure, the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ), was then published in 1981 by psychologist Marsha M. Linehan. The SSI and SBQ are often used in conjunction. Subsequent instruments were later developed, including the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL) in 1983, also developed by Linehan and the Life Orientation Inventory by Kowalchuk and King in 1992. Other valid and reliable instruments recommended by researchers to determine suicidal risk are the Manchester Self-Harm Rule, the Re-ACT Self-Harm Rule, the Risk Assessment Matrix, and the Violence and Suicide Assessment Form. Brief assessments are also available through the American Counseling Association, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the American School Counselor Association, and the National Institute of Mental Health.

Current Status and Results
Research on suicide assessment indicates that some practitioners refrain from using formal suicide-specific risk assessments, but rather rely on the information obtained during clinical interviews. Graduate programs should incorporate coursework, training, and practice in administering these assessments in order to increase
 

practitioner exposure and confidence. Suicidality, though, is not definitive and can be prevented if addressed effectively. Therefore, suicide risk should be reevaluated and monitored on a continual basis until potential self-harm is no longer imminent.


Suicide in Youth

Suicide in youth, or youth suicide, is described as when a young person, between the ages of 10 and 24, engages in dangerous, lethal behaviors with the intent to end his or her own life.

Definitions
Suicide contagion, also known as copycat suicide, refers to the phenomenon that occurs when, in the absence of protective factors, an individual chooses to kill himself.
